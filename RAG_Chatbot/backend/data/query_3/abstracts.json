        "abstract_content": "INTRODUCTION: Hypertension (HT) is a leading modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, but resting blood pressure (BP) measurements often miss hypertensive episodes during daily activities, affecting 10-15% of adults. A hypertensive response to exercise (HRE), characterized by abnormally high systolic BP (SBP) increases, is associated with future arterial HT and cardiovascular events, even in normotensive individuals and athletes. Despite its clinical significance, definitions of HRE vary widely, leading to inconsistent incidence estimates. The aim of this study was to collect available values of HRE and investigate definitions for HRE.\nEVIDENCE ACQUISITION: This systematic review followed PRISMA guidelines, conducting a comprehensive search of MEDLINE and Embase from 1974 to 2024. The search included studies on normotensive adults and athletes with or without HRE, focusing on BP cutoffs across exercise modalities and intensities. Eligible study designs included original research studies of any design, while reviews, case reports, and meta-analyses were excluded. Data extraction and synthesis involved multiple reviewers to ensure accuracy, with results presented in narrative and tabular formats.\nEVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: A total of 25 studies with 15,391 participants (weighted mean age 50 years, 28.3% female, 5.4% athletes) were analyzed, encompassing various study designs, including cross-sectional, case-control, cohort, and longitudinal studies. Exercise test protocols included treadmill (14 studies), bicycle ergometry (seven), shuttle/runs (three), and hand-grip strength (one), with most studies utilizing peak exercise intensities and automated BP measurements. Cut-offs for HRE varied, with most studies using SBP thresholds of \u2265210 mmHg for men and \u2265190 mmHg for women, though some studies proposed higher thresholds or included diastolic BP criteria. Definitions and methodologies for HRE were heterogeneous, reflecting variability across studies. Age, sex, fitness level, and test protocols significantly influence BP response, yet these factors are mostly omitted in the definition of HRE, with older adults and postmenopausal women showing exaggerated responses. Athletes exhibit higher peak SBP during exercise due to increased peak exercise cardiac output and augmented muscular strength enabling the athletes to push peak SBP higher, but thresholds applied are often the same as for non-athletes, underscoring the need for fitness-specific cut-offs. Variations in test protocols, measurement methods, and reliance on legacy cut-offs, which have been reproduced over decades further complicate consensus on standardized thresholds.\nCONCLUSIONS: Standardized, phenotype-specific criteria are essential to improve diagnostic accuracy and guide clinical recommendations in HRE."

However, reference values are currently unavailable for populations living at high altitudes. This study aimed to establish normative values for the five repetitions sit-to-stand test in the population living 2500 meters above sea level.\nMETHODS: A multicenter, cross-sectional research was carried out, collecting data from two high-altitude cities in Ecuador. Healthy adults aged 18 to 80 were recruited. Anthropometric measurements, physical activity levels, and tobacco use were registered. Reference equations were determined using multiple linear regression separately for men and women. The predictive model was generated using stepwise method.\nRESULTS: 400 healthy subjects (58% women) were recruited in the study. The participants had a median (P25 to P75) height of 1.62 (1.56 to 1.68) m, weight of 63.0 (57.8 to 70.1) kg, and Body Mass Index of 24.2 (22.5 to 26.0) kg/m. For men aged 18 to 29 years, the results for the five repetitions sit-to-stand test ranged from (P25 to P75) 5.1 to 9.3 seconds and between 8.2 to 12.2 seconds for people aged 70 to 80 years. For women aged 18 to 29 years, the results for five repetitions sit-to-stand test ranged from (P25 to P75) 5.0 to 7.9 seconds and between 8.2 to 14.3 seconds in the range 70 to 80 years.\nCONCLUSIONS: Reference values were established for the five repetitions sit-to-stand test in the healthy population living at high altitudes, between 18 and 80 years old."

However, research on V\u0307O<sub>2</sub>peak reference values and predictive equations for the Chinese population remains limited. This study aimed to establish a V\u0307O<sub>2</sub>peak predictive equation for Chinese adults. This study analyzed healthy participants who underwent CPET at Peking University Third Hospital (PUTH) from September 1, 2017, to September 1, 2023. Data from September 1, 2017, and August 31, 2021 were used as the derivation cohort, and September 1, 2021, to September 1, 2023 were utilized as an external validation cohort for temporal validation. The derivation cohort underwent backward multivariate regression analysis to generate the V\u0307O<sub>2</sub>peak prediction equation, which was compared with the widely-used Wasserman, FRIEND and Xiangya equations. The PUTH derivation cohort (N\u2009=\u20094531, mean age: 50.7\u00a0years, 18-88\u00a0years) and validation cohort (N\u2009=\u20094624, mean age: 46.1\u00a0years, 18-89\u00a0years) included 48.8 and 48.5% men, respectively. With increasing age, both men and women V\u0307O<sub>2</sub>peak exhibited a general decline. The predictive equation for V\u0307O<sub>2</sub>peak was established based on the derivation cohort: V\u0307O<sub>2</sub>peak (mL\u00b7min-1)\u2009=\u2009\u2009-24364.9\u2009-\u2009621.3\u2009\u00d7\u2009Sex (Women\u2009=\u20091, Men\u2009=\u20092)\u00a0-10.7\u2009\u00d7\u2009Age\u2009+\u20090.2\u2009\u00d7\u2009Height2 (cm)\u2009+\u20096464.7\u2009\u00d7\u2009Log(BMI)\u00a0-24997.2\u2009\u00d7\u2009Log(BSA)\u2009+12388.6\u2009\u00d7\u2009Log(LBM) (adjusted R2\u2009=\u20090.624, p\u2009&lt;\u20090.001). It demonstrated higher consistency between measured and predicted results compared to Xiangya, Wasserman, and FRIEND equations. This study presents the PUTH equation, a new V\u0307O<sub>2</sub>peak prediction equation for Chinese adults.

The intensity distribution of PA was expressed in absolute and relative terms. The outcome was mortality.\nRESULTS: PA volume (average acceleration) and absolute intensity were lower with increasing age (~-0.03\u2009to -0.04 SD of mean value across all ages per year; p<0.001) but differences in relative intensity by age were markedly smaller in women (-0.003 SD; p<0.184) and men (-0.012 SD; p<0.001). Absolute intensity was higher in men, but relative intensity higher in women (p<0.001). Over a median (IQR) follow-up of 8.1 (7.5-8.6) years, 121 (2.4 per 1000-person-years) deaths occurred in women and 203 (5.0 per 1000-person-years) in men. Lower risk of mortality was observed for increasing absolute or relative intensity in women, but for absolute intensity only in men. In men, the lowest risk (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.43, 0.91) was observed in those with high absolute intensity (80th centile), but low relative intensity (20th centile). Conversely, in women, the lowest risk was associated with high levels (80th centile) of both absolute and relative intensity (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.41, 0.86).\nCONCLUSION: Absolute PA intensity dropped with age, while relative intensity was fairly stable. Associations between PA intensity and mortality suggest that prescribing intensity in absolute terms appears appropriate for men, while either absolute or relative terms may be appropriate for women."

Workplace supervised exercise (WSE) programs can improve physical fitness and personal resources, though their adoption in organizations is limited. This study examines the impact of a long-term WSE program on the psychological capital of public administration employees. Fifty-five participants completed PC questionnaires and attended at least 40% of the sessions; 49.1% were women, and 40% were over 50 years old (age range: 24-73 years). A quasi-experimental design without a control group was used with a longitudinal design, and a nine-month WSE program (from October to June) was implemented. The data show gender-specific variations in PC patterns. Among men, incremental increases were observed over the three measurement intervals, with statistical significance achieved only in self-efficacy and hope. Among women, an upward trend was observed between October and February without statistical significance, followed by a slight decline. The results suggest that the WSE program may enhance personal resources, particularly hope and self-efficacy, highlighting the importance of tailoring WSE programs to the specific characteristics of the target group."

Participants completed a muscle oxygenation (%SmO<sub>2</sub>) zero-slope prediction trial and a 3-min all-out trial (3MT). The %SmO<sub>2</sub> zero-slope trials included three, 5-min cycling bouts (30-s rest) spanning intensity domains. Linear regression of trial work rate and %SmO<sub>2</sub> slope over the final 3 min established the work rate occurring at the predicted zero slope in %SmO<sub>2</sub>. The 3MT required cycling all-out until the word \"stop\" without providing time elapsed.

Revamping pace distribution: A case study on elevating the men's 400 m track and field Japanese national record after 32 years. J Strength Cond Res 39(4): e610-e615, 2025-Many studies have investigated the 400-m sprint, and the optimal pacing strategy is subject to debate. Little information is available regarding the effects of changes in the pacing strategy on running speed and spatiotemporal variables in the official 400-m race. This case study analyzed changes in running speed and spatiotemporal variables of a Japanese elite long sprinter who set a new Japanese national record in the 400-m race by modifying his pace distribution based on the analysis of his previous races and the performances of world-class long sprinters. To revamp his pace distribution, 25 preceding races (ranging from 45.47 to 46.95 seconds) were analyzed, spanning from June 2015 to June 2023. The independent variables were the 50-m split time, average running speed, percentage of the 50-m split time relative to the 400-m record, step length, and step frequency. K.S. broke his own record by modifying the pacing distribution based on the development of his previous race and the world-class long sprinters. The modified pacing strategy increased running speed in the 200- to 300-m section. Step lengths were longer throughout the 400 m, and step frequencies were higher in the last 200 m than before the alteration in the pace distribution. Modifying the pacing strategy from leading to driving may enhance the personal records of long sprinters. This improvement is attributed to the maintenance of longer step lengths over the entire 400-m range and an increase in the step frequency in the last 200 m."

However, its association with the development of atrial fibrillation (AF) remains largely unexplored.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: 451,089 participants (mean age 56.5 years) without cardiovascular disease (year 2006-2010) were included from the UK Biobank study. Stair climbing data was collected through touchscreen questionnaire. AF cases were identified using ICD-10 code: I48 and were followed until February 1, 2022. Models adjusted for traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Over a median follow-up of 12.6 years, 23,660 (5.2\u00a0%) participants experienced new-onset AF. In multivariable-adjusted models, climbing 10-50, 60-100, 110-150, and \u2265160 steps of stairs per day were associated with significant reductions in the risk of AF, compared to not climbing any stairs. The risk reduction appeared more pronounced in women than in men (P for interaction\u00a0=\u00a00.09). When compared to participants who climbed no stairs, the HRs for those who climbed 110-150 steps of stairs per day were 0.69 (95\u00a0% CI: 0.58-0.82) among those with low cardiorespiratory fitness, 0.71 (95\u00a0% CI: 0.57-0.88) among those with intermediate cardiorespiratory fitness, and 0.83 (95\u00a0% CI: 0.64-1.07) among those with high cardiorespiratory fitness.\nCONCLUSIONS: Climbing stairs was associated with a reduction in AF risks. Significant interaction between cardiorespiratory fitness and stair climbing associated with incident AF was observed. Findings suggest that promoting regular stair climbing could be a potential target for preventing AF onset."

The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) highlight its potential to be as an effective nutritional supplement to support muscular function performance in healthy adults. However, the effects of H<sub>2</sub> supplementation on muscular endurance performance in trained individuals have not been well characterized. This study aimed to assess the effects of intermittent hydrogen-rich water (HRW) supplementation before, during, and after resistance training on muscular endurance performance, neuromuscular status, and subjective perceptual responses after a 48-h recovery period.\nMETHODS: This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled cross-over study included 18 trained men aged 19.7 \u00b1 0.9\u00a0years. Participants in this study were instructed to consume 1,920\u00a0mL of HRW or pure water (Placebo) daily for 7\u00a0days. Additionally, participants were required to supplement with HRW or pure water five times during the training day (1,260\u00a0mL total). This included drinking 210\u00a0mL 30\u00a0min and 1\u00a0min before training, 210\u00a0mL between training sets, 210\u00a0mL immediately after training, and 420\u00a0mL 30\u00a0min into the recovery period. Participants performed half-squat exercises with the load set at 70% of one repetition maximum for six sets (half-squat exercise performed to repetitions failure each set). We measured the power output and number of repetitions in the free barbell half-squat used to assess muscular endurance performance in participants. The countermovement jump (CMJ) height, total quality recovery scale (TQRS), and muscle soreness visual analog scale (VAS) scores were measured to assess fatigue recovery status after training, as well as at 24 and 48\u00a0h of recovery.\nRESULTS: The total power output (HRW: 50,866.7 \u00b1 6,359.9W, Placebo: 46,431.0 \u00b1 9,376.5W, p = 0.032) and the total number of repetitions (HRW:78.2 \u00b1 9.5 repetitions, Placebo: 70.3 \u00b1 9.5 repetitions, p = 0.019) in the H<sub>2</sub> supplemented group were significantly higher than in the placebo group. However, there was no statistically significant difference (p&lt; 0.05) between the H<sub>2</sub> and placebo groups in CMJ, TQRS, and VAS.\nCONCLUSION: Eight days of intermittent HRW intake could significantly improve muscular endurance performance in trained individuals, making it a promising strategy for athletes or fitness enthusiasts looking to boost muscular endurance during resistance training or competitions. However, it should be noted that HRW intake alone may not be adequate to accelerate recovery from muscle soreness or fatigue following high-intensity training."

        "abstract_content": "BACKGROUND: A shift from self-reports to wearable sensors for global physical activity (PA) surveillance has been recommended. The conventional use of a generic cut-point to assess moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) is problematic as these cut-points are often derived from non-representative samples under non-ecological laboratory conditions. This study aimed to develop age- and sex- (age-sex) specific cut-points for MVPA based on population-standardized values as a feasible approach to assess the adherence to PA guidelines and to investigate its associations with all-cause mortality.\nMETHODS: A total of 7601 participants (20-85+ years) were drawn from the 2003-2004 and 2005-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). Minutes per week of MVPA were assessed with a hip-worn accelerometer. Counts per minute (CPM) were used to define an age-sex specific target intensity, representing the intensity each person should be able to reach based on their age and sex. Age-sex specific MVPA cut-points were defined as any activity above 40% of the target intensity. These population- and free-living-based age-sex specific cut-points overcome many of the limitations of the standard generic cut-point approach. For comparison, we also calculated MVPA with a generic cut-point of 1952 CPM. Both approaches were compared for assessing adherence to PA guidelines and association of MVPA with all-cause mortality (ascertained through December 2015).\nRESULTS: Both approaches indicated that 37% of the sample met the 150+ min/week guideline. The generic cut-point approach showed a trend to inactivity with age, which was less pronounced using the age-sex specific cut-points. Overall mortality rates were comparable using generic cut-point (hazard ratio (HR)\u202f=\u202f0.61, 95% confidence interval (95%CI): 0.50\u20120.73) or age-sex specific cut-points (HR\u202f=\u202f0.57, 95%CI: 0.50\u20120.66) for the entire sample. The generic cut-point method revealed an age- and sex-related gap in the benefits of achieving 150+ min/week of MVPA, with older adults showing an 18% greater reduction in mortality rates than younger adults, and a larger difference in women than in men. This disparity disappeared when using age-sex specific cut-points.\nCONCLUSION: Our findings underscore the value of age-sex specific cut-points for global PA surveillance. MVPA defined with age-sex specific thresholds was associated with all-cause mortality and the dose\u2012response was similar for all ages and sexes. This aligns with the single recommendation of accumulating 150+ min/week MVPA for all adults, irrespective of age and sex. This study serves as a proof of concept to develop this methodology for PA surveillance over more advanced open-source acceleration metrics and other national and international cohorts."

In this cohort study, we examined the associations between Mediterranean or Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet adherence and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) with later-life dementia, and assessed whether the associations between dietary pattern and dementia are modified by CRF.\nMETHODS: Data are from 9,095 adults seeking preventive care at the Cooper Clinic (1987-1999) who completed a 3-day dietary record and a maximal exercise test. Alzheimer's disease and related disorders or senile dementia (i.e., all-cause dementia) was identified from Medicare administrative claims (1999-2019). Illness-death models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations between Mediterranean or DASH diet adherence (primary exposure), CRF (secondary exposure), and all-cause dementia, adjusted for demographic and clinical factors. An interaction term was included between diet score and CRF to assess effect modification by CRF.\nRESULTS: The mean age at baseline was 50.6 (standard deviation [SD]: 8.4) years, and a majority of the study sample were men (77.5%) and White (96.4%). 1449 cases of all-cause dementia were identified over a mean follow-up of 9.2 (SD: 5.8) years. Neither Mediterranean nor DASH diet adherence was associated with dementia risk in fully adjusted models (HR per SD of Mediterranean diet score: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.94, 1.05; HR per SD of DASH diet score: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.96, 1.08). However, participants with higher CRF had a decreased hazard of dementia (HR, per metabolic equivalent of task [MET] increase, Mediterranean model: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.92, 0.98; HR, per MET increase, DASH model: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.92, 0.97). No effect modification by CRF was observed in the association between diet and dementia.\nCONCLUSIONS: In this sample of apparently healthy middle-aged adults seeking preventive care, higher CRF at midlife was associated with a lower risk of all-cause dementia, though adherence to a Mediterranean or DASH diet was not, and CRF did not modify the diet-dementia association. CRF should be emphasized in multimodal interventions for dementia prevention and investigated among diverse samples."

Zinc (Zn) plays critical roles in several biochemical processes in exercise physiology, especially during intense physical exercise. This research aimed to analyze erythrocyte, platelet, plasma and urine Zn concentrations among men's and female soccer players over a sports season. A total of 22 male soccer players (20.61 \u00b1 2.66 years; 71.50 \u00b1 5.93 kg) and 24 female soccer players (23.37 \u00b1 3.95 years; 59.58 \u00b1 7.17 kg) participated in this longitudinal quasi-experimental study. Three assessments were carried out over the season: 1st evaluation: first week of training (August); 2nd assessment: middle of the season, between the end of the first and second round (January) and 3rd assessment: last week of training (May/June). In all evaluations extracellular (plasma and urine) and intracellular (erythrocytes and platelets) Zn concentrations were determined, as well as physical fitness and several blood parameters. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry was used to measure Zn concentrations. Plasma and urinary concentrations were higher among male soccer players (p &lt; 0.05) while erythrocyte and platelet Zn concentrations were higher in the female soccer players (p &lt; 0.05). Additionally, variations in urinary and platelet Zn concentrations were observed over the season. The differences could be related to muscle mass, muscle damage or the specific sport's physical demands."

Most participants trained for over two years (49.4%), primarily in supervised groups. Motivations for engaging in CrossFit\u00ae included health prevention (33.1%), athletic training (32.8%), and work-life balance support (17%). Injuries were reported by 28.6% of participants, with 61.4% experiencing single injuries. The majority of injuries (55.3%) occurred during the middle of workouts. Injury types included wounds (23.3%), contusions, sprains, or strains (cumulative 30.8%), and fractures (2.9%). Almost all injured individuals (96.5%) had a time-loss injury, with a return to sport ranging from a day to over three months. Treatments varied, with 50.6% not requiring medical intervention, 34.1% undergoing physiotherapy, 21.2% receiving medication and 8.2% needing surgery. Barbell exercises, notably Snatch and Clean, were main exercises with association to injuries, accounting for 36.3%. The Box Jump stood out as the exercise with the highest isolated injury prevalence (14.3%). Notable injury causes included falls during Pull-Ups and lumbar disc herniation linked to Deadlifts. Following injuries, 45.8% of participants made training adjustments.\nCONCLUSION: This study provides an epidemiological investigation into the types and causes of injuries during CrossFit\u00ae training in Germany. The shoulder and knee joint exhibited the highest injury prevalence. Barbell exercises, box jumps, and bar pull-ups were identified as major exercises with association to injuries. Prevention through technical training and the incorporation of soft boxes could reduce the risk of injuries in CrossFit\u00ae."

        "abstract_content": "BACKGROUND: High-velocity concentric actions can be negatively impacted by cumulative fatigue during plyometric training. Reducing vertical ground reaction forces (GRF) upon landing could decrease eccentric demands, potentially minimizing fatigue, maintaining concentric performance, and benefiting concentric training adaptations. Therefore, this study examined the effect of intentionally higher and lower landing vertical GRF on the ability to sustain concentric jumping performance.\nMETHODS: Twenty men (25.2\u00b13.5 years) performed 30 maximal effort jumps over a 50 cm hurdle (high-landing GRF) and onto a 50 cm box (low-landing GRF), on two separate occasions in a counter-balanced order. Jumps were measured using two force platforms (one for takeoff and one for landing) and a linear position transducer. The 30 jumps were divided into 5 groups of 6 repetitions, and the mean value for each group was analyzed.\nRESULTS: There was no significant condition \u00d7 repetition group interaction for any parameters, indicating that the greater landing GRF during hurdle jumps did not negatively affect concentric jump performance throughout the 30 jumps. Concentric velocities and jump height were significantly greater during box jumps compared to hurdle jumps.\nCONCLUSIONS: Thirty maximal-effort jumps did not cause fatigue-related decrease of performance, independent of jump type (i.e., the magnitude of landing GRF). Although, reduced vertical GRF upon landing appears to have a neutral-to-positive effect on concentric jumping performance. Therefore, reducing landing GRF, such as by using BJs, could acutely augment jumping performance and help to reduce cumulative training load."

Field-based tests may provide a reasonable alternative compared to advanced laboratory testing. Separating postexercise test scores from reactivity measurements requires sufficient test-retest reliability. Postexercise test scores with reliability analyses of field-based fitness tests in older adults are lacking. The present study aimed to examine the test-retest reliability of some novel easily accommodated fitness test measurements and compare pretest scores with postexercise results in these tests along with other field-based fitness tests in older adults.\nMETHODS: Totally 1,407 community-dwelling older adults (69% female), x\u0304 = 71.5 \u00b1 5.0 (65-84 years), performed twelve field-based fitness tests at pretest 1, pretest 2 and a posttest after an 8-week exercise period (twice weekly 1 h of combined strength and aerobic training). T tests, intra-class correlation, limits of agreement, standard error of measurement, and coefficient of variance were performed between pre-1 and pre-2 tests, and repeated measures ANOVA and partial eta squared effect size for postexercise differences for men and women in 5-year age groups ranging from 65 to 84 years.\nRESULTS: Between pre-1 and pre-2 tests a significant difference was noted in some of the novel fitness test measurements but generally not, e.g., in isometric trunk flexion and step-up height on either leg among all sex and age groups. In most of these novel fitness test measurements, no significant differences occurred between the two pretests. Examples of results from the pre-2 test to the posttest were isometric trunk flexion 45\u00b0 endurance and isometric trunk extension endurance improved significantly for both sexes in age groups 65-74 years. Women, but not men, improved the maximal step-up height for both legs in most age groups. The speed in the 50 sit-to-stand improved significantly for most age groups in both sexes. Six-min walk distance improved significantly for most age groups in women but among men only in 65-69 years. In the timed-up-and-go test, significant improvements were seen for all age groups in women and in men 70-79 years. No postexercise improvements were generally observed for grip strength or balance.\nCONCLUSIONS: In most of the novel fitness test measures, no significant difference was noted between the two pretests in the assessed sex and age groups. Results after the 8-week exercise period varied between sex and age groups, with significant improvements in several of the twelve studied fitness tests. These findings may be valuable for future projects utilizing easily accommodated physical fitness tests in older adults."

The objective of this study was to describe time trends in CR participation between 2013 and 2019 and provides insights into the utilization of CR components.\nMETHODS: Patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) with an indication for CR were enrolled between 2013 and 2019. Dutch health insurance claims data were used to identify CR participation and its components.\nRESULTS: In total, 106\u2009212 patients with CVD were included of which 37% participated in CR. Participation significantly increased from 28% in 2013 to 41% in 2016 but remained unchanged thereafter. Participation was highest in the youngest age groups (<50 yrs 52%; 50-65 yrs 50%), men (48%), patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (73%), non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (59%), and coronary artery bypass grafting (82%). In contrast, it was the lowest in the oldest age group (\u226585\u00a0yrs 8%), women (30%), and in patients with heart failure (11%). Most participants in CR received referral plus an admission session (97%) and exercise training (82%), whereas complementary services related to dietary (14%) and mental health counseling (10%) had a low utilization.\nCONCLUSIONS: CR participation rates increased to 41% in 2016 but remained unchanged thereafter. Participation modulators included age, sex, CVD diagnosis, and undergoing a cardiothoracic procedure. Education and exercise sessions were frequently adopted, but dietary and mental health counseling had a low utilization rate. These findings suggest the need for reinvigorated referral and novel enrollment strategies in specific CVD subgroups to further promote CR participation and its associated underutilized adjunctive services."

In addition, subgroup analysis according to age (&lt;/\u226554 years) and sex (female/male) is performed. Ceramides are quantified by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). CR fitness is assessed by a cardiopulmonary exercise test. Sex and age independent associations are found for higher levels of C24:0 and C24:0/C16:0 ratio with higher maximal oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>peak)\u00a0kg-1 and oxygen consumption at the anaerobic threshold (VO<sub>2</sub>@AT<sub>1</sub>) as well as for the relation of C24:0/C16:0 with maximum workload (Wattmax\u00a0kg-1). In contrast, age/sex subgroup specific inverse associations with Wattmax\u00a0kg-1 are found in women &lt;54 years for C22:0, while a positive association in men \u226554 years. Higher levels of C24:0 are associated with higher Wattmax\u00a0kg-1, except for women &lt;54 years, where no significant association can be found. The findings suggest that the use of single ceramides as cardiovascular biomarkers may be inferior, compared to ceramide ratio C24:0/C16:0. Therefore C24:0/C16:0 ratio may be a more suitable and robust cardiovascular biomarker and should be preferred over single ceramides."

Polyester sportwear is proposed to improve the evaporation but its effectiveness remains overlooked. We investigated physiological effects of exercise in heat while wearing a polyester versus cotton T-shirt on thermoregulation, perspiration, and cardiovascular regulations.\nMETHODS: Physically active men with obesity (N.=7; 21.7\u00b11.7 years old; VO<inf>2peak</inf> 36.8\u00b18.7 mL/kg/min; body fat percentage 34.7\u00b14.3%) performed two randomized, crossover walking sessions for 30 mins (27 \u00b0C; 12% relative humidity) while wearing a polyester or cotton T-shirt, separated by a 7-day wash out period. Thermoregulation was assessed by measuring tympanic, torso (back and chest), and peripheral (forehead and forearm) skin temperatures. Perspiration rate was estimated as the difference in body weight (pre minus post walking). Heart rate was measured by a Polar heart rate monitor. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured by a sphygmomanometer. All measurements were performed pre, during, and post each session. Two-way ANOVA examined main effects of time, fabric type, and their interactions on the study's outcomes.\nRESULTS: Back and chest temperatures increased (\u2206=1.6 \u00b0C and 0.9 \u00b0C, respectively) while forehead and forearm temperatures decreased (\u2206=-0.5 \u00b0C and -1.6 \u00b0C, respectively) over time (P<0.05 for all). Only forehead temperature had an interaction effect for time by fabric type where greater decrease was observed during the polyester T-shirt session compared to the cotton T-shirt session (\u2206=-0.1 vs. -0.8 \u00b0C; P=0.016). Heart rate (\u2206=27.8 beat/min) and systolic blood pressure (\u2206=7.5 mmHg) increased while diastolic blood pressure (\u2206=-5.0 mmHg) decreased over time (P<0.05 for all). No difference observed for perspiratory rate (P>0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: The current findings do not support the superiority of polyester or cotton sportwear for better thermoregulatory, perspiratory, and cardiovascular regulations in physically active men with obesity. Future research should examine the effectiveness of other alternative fabrics of sportwear for better physiological responses when exercising in the heat, particularly in adults with obesity."

For this reason, there has been an increasing focus on physical and mental health of the elderly, promoting the concept of healthy aging. The aim of this study was to explore the associations between perceived physical and mental health of older adults and a variety of determinants, such as demographic factors, physical functional fitness, physical activity level, adherence to the Mediterranean diet and anthropometric indices, through a structural equation modeling (SEM). A cross-sectional observational study involved 208 elderly (24 men and 184 women) over the age of 60, fully independent and autonomous. Perceived physical and mental health were assessed with the Short Form 12 questionnaire. Basic sociodemographic information was collected; anthropometric features were directly measured, functional fitness was assessed with the Senior Fitness Test, and physical activity level was determined through the International Physical Activity Questionnaire; adherence to Mediterranean Diet (MD) was also collected through the MEDAS questionnaire. The SEM analysis revealed that functional fitness, which was a latent variable of the model described by the six administered fitness tests, was a strong predictor both of perceived physical and perceived mental health in the sample of elderly. Physical activity level was as predictor of the perceived physical component, but not of the mental health, while score of metabolic equivalent task did not result a predictor, as well as the sociodemographic factors and adherence to MD. The present findings suggest that it would be strongly recommended for elderly subjects to engage in physical activity specifically targeted to aged populations, in order to enhance their fitness abilities and enable them to improve the perception of their own health status."

Given this unique body composition, the optimal exercise regimen for this population is unknown.\nMETHODS: We conducted a parallel-group RCT in individuals with type 2 diabetes (age 18-80 years, HbA<sub>1c</sub> 47.5-118.56 mmol/mol [6.5-13.0%]) and BMI &lt;25 kg/m2). Participants were recruited in outpatient clinics or through advertisements and randomly assigned to a 9 month exercise programme of strength training alone (ST), aerobic training alone (AER) or both interventions combined (COMB). We used stratified block randomisation with a randomly selected block size. Researchers and caregivers were blinded to participants' treatment group; however, participants themselves were not. Exercise interventions were conducted at community-based fitness centres. The primary outcome was absolute change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> level within and across the three groups at 3, 6 and 9 months. Secondary outcomes included changes in body composition at 9 months. Per adherence to recommended exercise protocol (PP) analysis included participants who completed at least 50% of the sessions.\nRESULTS: Among 186 individuals (ST, n=63; AER, n=58; COMB, n=65) analysed, the median (IQR) age was 59 (53-66) years, 60% were men and 83% were Asian. The mean (SD) HbA<sub>1c</sub> level at baseline was 59.6 (13.1) mmol/mol (7.6% [1.2%]). In intention-to-treat analysis, the ST group showed a significant decrease in HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels (mean [95% CI] -0.44 percentage points [-0.78, -0.12], p=0.002), while no significant change was observed in either the COMB group (-0.35 percentage points, p=0.13) or the AER group (-0.24 percentage points, p=0.10). The ST group had a greater improvement in HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels than the AER group (p=0.01). Appendicular lean mass relative to fat mass increased only in the ST group (p=0.0008), which was an independent predictor of HbA<sub>1c</sub> change (beta coefficient -7.16, p=0.01). Similar results were observed in PP analysis. Only one adverse event, in the COMB group, was considered to be possibly associated with the exercise intervention.\nCONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In normal-weight type 2 diabetes, strength training was superior to aerobic training alone, while no significant difference was observed between strength training and combination training for HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction. Increased lean mass relative to decreased fat mass was an independent predictor of reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> level.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02448498.\nFUNDING: This study was funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH; R01DK081371)."

        "abstract_content": "Background: Aerobic exercise could produce a positive effect on the brain by releasing brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). In untrained healthy humans there seems to be a linear correlation between exercise duration and the positive effect of acute aerobic exercise on brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels. Therefore, we performed two different duration of high-intensity interval training protocols (HIIT), both known to improve cardiovascular fitness, to determine whether then have a similar efficacy in affecting brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels. Methods: 12 untrained young males (aged 23.7 \u00b1 1.8\u00a0years), participated in a randomized controlled cross-over trial. They underwent two different work-to-rest ratio high-intensity interval training protocols: high-intensity interval training 1 (30\u00a0min, 15 intervals of 1\u00a0min efforts at 85%-90% VO2max with 1\u00a0min of active recovery at 50%-60% VO2max) and HIIT2 (30\u00a0min, 10 intervals of 2\u00a0min efforts at 85%-90% VO2max with 1\u00a0min of active recovery at 50%-60% VO2max). Serum cortisol, brain-derived neurotrophic factor were collected at baseline, immediately following intervention, and 30\u00a0min into recovery for measurements using a Sandwich ELISA method, blood lactate was measured by using a portable lactate analyzer. Results: Our results showed that the similar serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor change in both high-intensity interval training protocols, with maximal serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels being reached toward the end of intervention. There was no significant change in serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor from baseline after 30\u00a0min recovery. We then showed that both high-intensity interval training protocols significantly increase blood lactate and serum cortisol compared with baseline value (high-intensity interval training p &lt; 0.01; high-intensity interval training 2 p &lt; 0.01), with high-intensity interval training 2 reaching higher blood lactate levels than high-intensity interval training 1 (p = 0.027), but no difference was observed in serum cortisol between both protocols. Moreover, changes in serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor did corelate with change in blood lactate (high-intensity interval training 1 r = 0.577, p &lt; 0.05; high-intensity interval training 2 r = 0.635, p &lt; 0.05), but did not correlate with the change in serum cortisol. Conclusions: brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels in untrained young men are significantly increased in response to different work-to-rest ratio of high-intensity interval training protocols, and the magnitude of increase is exercise duration independent. Moreover, the higher blood lactate did not raise circulating brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Therefore, given that prolonged exercise causes higher levels of cortisol. We suggest that the 1:1work-to-rest ratio of high-intensity interval training protocol might represent a preferred intervention for promoting brain health."

However, as the health benefits are small and confounded by heterogeneity, there remains uncertainty as to which patient groups are most helped by wearable trackers.\nOBJECTIVE: This study examined the effects of wearable trackers in patients with cardiometabolic conditions to identify subgroups of patients who most benefited and to understand interventional differences.\nMETHODS: We obtained individual participant data from randomized controlled trials of wearable trackers that were conducted before December 2020 and measured steps per day as the primary outcome in participants with cardiometabolic conditions including diabetes, overweight or obesity, and cardiovascular disease. We used statistical models to account for clustering of participants within trials and heterogeneity across trials to estimate mean differences with the 95% CI.\nRESULTS: Individual participant data were obtained from 9 of 25 eligible randomized controlled trials, which included 1481 of 3178 (47%) total participants. The wearable trackers revealed that over the median duration of 12 weeks, steps per day increased by 1656 (95% CI 918-2395), a significant change. Greater increases in steps per day from interventions using wearable trackers were observed in men (interaction coefficient -668, 95% CI -1157 to -180), patients in age categories over 50 years (50-59 years: interaction coefficient 1175, 95% CI 377-1973; 60-69 years: interaction coefficient 981, 95% CI 222-1740; 70-90 years: interaction coefficient 1060, 95% CI 200-1920), White patients (interaction coefficient 995, 95% CI 360-1631), and patients with fewer comorbidities (interaction coefficient -517, 95% CI -1188 to -11) compared to women, those aged below 50, non-White patients, and patients with multimorbidity. In terms of interventional differences, only face-to-face delivery of the tracker impacted the effectiveness of the interventions by increasing steps per day.\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with cardiometabolic conditions, interventions using wearable trackers to improve steps per day mostly benefited older White men without multimorbidity.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42019143012; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=143012."

        "abstract_content": "Background: Although evidence suggests that resistance training should be prescribed as a method to enhance or maintain physical fitness, these findings are mostly based on research on younger men. Studies investigating responses by sex and age to resistance training, especially in war veterans aged \u226550 years, are lacking. Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to examine whether a 4-week resistance training program would have similar effects on body composition, muscular fitness, and flexibility in men and women aged 50\u221280 years. Methods: Seven-hundred and sixty-four participants were recruited and categorized into two groups each of men and women aged 50\u221264 and 65\u221280 years. The training intervention lasted 4 weeks and consisted of three 60 min sessions per week. All participants were tested for each of the following physical fitness components: body composition, push-ups in 30 s, chair-stands in 30 s, sit-ups in 30 s, and a sit-and-reach test. Results: Over the intervention period of 4 weeks, body weight (p = 0.002) and the percent of fat mass (p < 0.001) decreased, while the percent of lean mass (p < 0.001) in push-ups in 30 s (p < 0.001), chair-stands in 30 s (p < 0.001), sit-ups in 30 s (p < 0.001), and sit-and-reach (p < 0.001) increased. Significant time*age interactions were shown for push-ups in 30 s (F1,763 = 4.348, p = 0.038) and chair-stands in 30 s (F1,763 = 9.552, p = 0.002), where men and women aged 50\u221264 years exhibited larger time-induced changes compared to their older (65\u221280 yr) counterparts. Effect sizes were similar between sex- and age-specific groups. Conclusions: The 4-week resistance training produced similar pronounced positive effects on body composition, muscular fitness, and flexibility, while men and women aged 50\u221264 years displayed significantly larger improvements in upper and lower muscular fitness compared with their 65\u221280-year-old counterparts."

Maximal and submaximal fitness were estimated by exercise duration and heart rate at the end of stage 2. Multivariable adjusted linear-mixed models were used to estimate fitness trajectories using age as the mechanism for time after adjustment for covariates. Fitness trajectories from ages 20 to 50 yr in 5-yr increments were estimated overall and by subgroups determined by each factor after adjustment for duration within the less favorable category.\nRESULTS: Mean (95% confidence interval) maximal fitness at age 20 and 50 yr was 613 (607-616) and 357 (350-362) s; submaximal heart rate during this period also reflected age-related fitness declines (126 (125-127) and 138 (137-138) bpm). Compared with men, women had lower maximal fitness at age 20 yr (P < 0.001), which persisted over follow-up (P < 0.001); differences were also found by race within sex strata (all P < 0.001). Differences in maximal fitness at age 20 yr were noted by socioeconomic, behavioral, and health-related status in young adulthood (all P < 0.05), which persisted over follow-up (all P < 0.001) and were generally consistent in sex-stratified analyses.\nCONCLUSIONS: Targeting individuals experiencing accelerated fitness declines with tailored intervention strategies may provide an opportunity to preserve fitness throughout midlife to reduce lifetime cardiovascular disease risk."

        "abstract_content": "BACKGROUND: The efficiency of aerobic energy provision to working skeletal muscle is affected by aerobic fitness and a prominent insertion/deletion polymorphism in the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE-I/D) gene for the major modulator of tissue perfusion. We assessed whether variability in the fitness state is dependent on the contribution of multiple aspects of oxygen transport to the development of muscle power, and the respective control coefficients, are associated with the ACE-I/D genotype.\nMETHODS: Twenty-five women and 19 men completed a ramp test of cycling exercise to exhaustion during which serial steps of oxygen transport [oxygen uptake (L O<sub>2</sub> min-1) (VO<sub>2</sub>), minute ventilation in (L min-1) (VE), cardiac output in equivalents of L min-1 (Q), arterial oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), muscle oxygen saturation (SmO<sub>2</sub>), and total hemoglobin concentration (g dL-1) (THb) in Musculus vastus lateralis and Musculus gastrocnemius, respiration exchange ratio (RER)], blood lactate and glucose concentration, were continuously monitored. The contribution/reliance of power output (PO) on the parameters of oxygen transport was estimated based on the slopes in Pearson's moment correlations (|r| &gt; 0.65, p &lt; 0.05) vs. power values over the work phase of the ramp test, and for respective fractional changes per time (defining control coefficients) over the rest, work, and recovery phase of the ramp test. Associations of variability in slopes and control coefficients with the genotype and aerobic fitness were evaluated with ANOVA.\nRESULTS: All parameters characterizing aspects of the pathway of oxygen, except THb, presented strong linear relationships [(|r| &gt; 0.70) to PO]. Metabolic efficiency was 30% higher in the aerobically fit subjects [peak oxygen uptake (mL O<sub>2</sub> min-1) (VO<sub>2</sub>peak) \u2265 50 ml min-1 kg-1], and energy expenditure at rest was associated with the fitness state \u00d7 ACE-I/D genotype, being highest in the fit non-carriers of the ACE D-allele. For VO<sub>2</sub>, VE, and RER the power-related slopes of linear relationships during work demonstrated an association with aerobic fitness, being 30-40% steeper in the aerobically fit than unfit subjects. For VE the power-related slope also demonstrated an association with the ACE-I/D genotype. For increasing deficit in muscle oxygen saturation (DSmO<sub>2</sub>) in Musculus vastus lateralis (DSmO<sub>2</sub> Vas), the power-related slope was associated with the interaction between aerobic fitness \u00d7 ACE-I/D genotype.\nCONCLUSION: Local and systemic aspects of aerobic energy provision stand under influence of the fitness state and ACE-I/D genotype. This especially concerns the association with the index of the muscle's mitochondrial respiration (SmO<sub>2</sub>) which compares to the genetic influences of endurance training."

It is unclear if this heat-induced blunting of the training response exists in females. The purpose of the present study was to determine the impact of 60 min of cycling in the heat over three weeks on thermoregulation, gene expression, and aerobic capacity in females. Untrained females (n = 22; 24 \u00b1 4yoa) were assigned to three weeks of aerobic training in either 20 \u00b0C (n = 12) or 33 \u00b0C (n = 10; 40%RH). Maximal aerobic capacity (39.5 \u00b1 6.5 to 41.5 \u00b1 6.2 mL\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7min\u22121, p = 0.021, \u03b7p2 = 0.240, 95% CI [0.315, 3.388]) and peak aerobic power (191.0 \u00b1 33.0 to 206.7 \u00b1 27.2 W, p < 0.001, \u03b7p2 = 0.531, 95% CI [8.734, 22.383]) increased, while the absolute-intensity trial (50%VO2peak) HR decreased (152 \u00b1 15 to 140 \u00b1 13 b\u00b7min\u22121, p < 0.001, \u03b7p2 = 0.691, 95% CI [15.925, 8.353]), but they were not different between temperatures (p = 0.440, p = 0.955, p = 0.341, respectively). Independent of temperature, Day 22 tolerance trial skin temperatures decreased from Day 1 (p = 0.006, \u03b7p2 = 0.319, 95% CI [1.408, 0.266), but training did not influence core temperature (p = 0.598).

Pre-training PGC-1\u03b1 mRNA increased 4h-post-exercise (5.29 \u00b1 0.70 fold change, p < 0.001), was lower post-training (2.69 \u00b1 0.22 fold change, p = 0.004), and was not different between temperatures (p = 0.455). While training induced some diminished transcriptional stimulus, generally the training temperature had little effect on genes related to mitochondrial biogenesis, mitophagy, and metabolic enzymes. These female participants increased aerobic fitness and maintained an exercise-induced PGC-1\u03b1 mRNA response in the heat equal to that of room temperature conditions, contrasting with the blunted responses previously observed in men."

        "abstract_content": "BACKGROUND: Injury prevalence data, muscle strength, and fatiguability differ between males and females. In addition, arm spatial orientation affects muscle activation and strength of the shoulder muscles. Nevertheless, little research has been conducted in relation to the shoulder rotator muscles comparing men and women. Therefore, the main aim of of this study was to perform a comparative investigation between two arm spatial orientations (45\u00b0 and 90\u00b0 of abduction in the frontal plane) during a fatigue assessment of the internal rotator (IR) and external rotator (ER) shoulder muscles. Secondly, the interaction between sex and dominance with muscular performance was assessed.\nMETHODS: Forty healthy sedentary participants, 20 males and 20 females took part in this study. Participants performed a fatigue resistance protocol consisting of 30 consecutive maximal concentric contractions of the IR and ER shoulder muscles in a supine position at a speed of 180\u00b0/s. The upper limb was abducted to an angle of 45\u00b0 or 90\u00b0 in the frontal plane and each participant was tested on the dominant and nom-dominant side, counterbalanced in order of administration. Performance measures of Induced Fatigue (IF; %), Cumulated Performance (C.Perf; J) and Best Repetition (BR; J) were calculated and used for analysis. IF represents the % difference between the amount of work done over the last 3 and first 3 repetitions, BR represents the largest amount of work done during a single contraction, and C.Perf represents the total amount of work done during all repetitions.\nRESULTS: Muscle group was the only factor to display significant variation when not considering other factors, with higher values for C.Perf (mean difference\u2009=\u2009353.59\u00a0J, P\u2009<\u20090.0005), BR (mean difference\u2009=\u200914.21\u00a0J, P\u2009<\u20090.0005) and IF (mean difference\u2009=\u20093.65%, P\u2009=\u20090.0046). There was a significant difference between both angles, with higher values observed at 90\u00b0 compared to 45\u00b0 of abduction for C.Perf by\u2009~\u20097.5% (mean difference\u2009=\u200975 to 152\u00a0J) and\u2009~\u200910.8% (mean difference\u2009=\u20095.1 to 9.4\u00a0J) for BR in the ER, in males and females respectively (P\u2009<\u20090.0005). The dominant arm was significantly stronger than the non-dominant arm for C.Perf by 11.7% (mean difference\u2009=\u2009111.58\u00a0J) for males and by 18% (mean difference\u2009=\u200982.77\u00a0J) for females in the ER at 45\u00b0 abduction. At 90\u00b0 abduction, only females were stronger in the dominant arm by 18.8% (mean difference\u2009=\u200988.17\u00a0J). Values for BR ranged from 9.2 to 21.8% depending on the abduction angle and sex of the athlete (mean difference\u2009=\u20092.44 - 4.85\u00a0J). Males were significantly stronger than females by 48.8 to 50.7% for values of C.Perf and BR in both the IR and ER (P\u2009<\u20090.0005). There was a significant difference between the ER and IR muscles, with significantly higher values observed for the IR in C.Perf (mean difference\u2009=\u2009331.74\u00a0J) by 30.0% and in BR (mean difference\u2009=\u200913.31\u00a0J) by 26.64%.\nDISCUSSION: Differences in shoulder performance fatiguability between sexes are affected by arm position, arm dominance and muscle groups. In agreement with the literature, performance values in males were approximately 50% higher than in females. However, the amount of IF was no different between both sexes. Based on findings in literature, it could be suggested that this is due to differences between males and females in motor control and/or coordination strategies during repetitive tasks. In addition, we also observed the IR muscles to be significantly stronger than the ER muscles. It has long been established in literature that these observations are due to the muscle-size differences between both muscle groups, where the IR muscles can produce a larger amount of force due to the larger cross-sectional area. Results of our study found similar ER:IR ratios compared to previous reports.\nCONCLUSION: Therefore, these findings are useful for clinicians when monitoring rehabilitation programs in sedentary individuals following shoulder injuries."

Both exercise and weight loss are lifestyle interventions that can affect glucose metabolism. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a six-month trial of aerobic exercise training or weight loss on signaling pathways in skeletal muscle in the basal condition and during hyperinsulinemia during a glucose clamp in middle-aged and older adults. Overweight and obese men and women aged 50-70 years were randomly allocated and completed six months of either weight loss (WL) (n = 18) or 3x/week aerobic exercise training (AEX) (n = 17). WL resulted in 10% weight loss and AEX increased maximal oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>max) (both p &lt; 0.001). Insulin sensitivity (hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic 80 mU\u00b7m-2\u00b7min-1 clamp) increased in WL and AEX (both p &lt; 0.01). In vivo insulin stimulation increased phosphorylation/total protein ratio (P/T) of protein kinase B (Akt), glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-\u03b23), 70 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6k), insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), and insulin receptor (IR) expression (all p &lt; 0.05) but not P/T extracellular regulated kinase \u00bd (ERK1/2), c-jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38), or insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R). There were differences between WL and AEX in the change in basal Akt P/T (p = 0.05), GSK-3\u03b2 P/T ratio (p &lt; 0.01), p70S6k (p &lt; 0.001), ERK1/2 (p = 0.01) P/T ratio but not p38, JNK, IRS-1, and IGF-1R P/T ratios. There was a difference between WL and AEX in the insulin stimulation changes in GSK3 which increased more after WL than AEX (p &lt; 0.05). In the total group, changes in M were associated with changes in basal total GSK-3\u03b2 and basal total p70Sk as well as insulin stimulation of total p70Sk. Protein signaling in skeletal muscle provides insight as to mechanisms for improvements in insulin sensitivity in aging and obesity."

Apps that do include behavioral components tend to be costly and often do not include strategies to help those who are unsure of how to increase their physical activity.\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of this pilot study is to test the efficacy of a new app, StepMATE, for increasing daily walking in a sample of inactive adults and to examine daily relationships between walking and self-reported mood and energy.\nMETHODS: The participants were middle-aged and older adults aged \u226550 years (mean 61.64, SD 7.67 years). They were randomly assigned to receive either a basic, pedometer-like version of the app or a version with supports to help them determine where, when, and with whom to walk. Of the 96 participants randomized to 1 of 2 conditions, 87 (91%) completed pretest assessments and 81 (84%) successfully downloaded the app. Upon downloading the app, step data from the week prior were automatically recorded. The participants in both groups were asked to set a daily walking goal, which they could change at any point during the intervention. They were asked to use the app as much as possible over the next 4 weeks. Twice per day, pop-up notifications assessed mood and energy levels.\nRESULTS: Although one group had access to additional app features, both groups used the app in a similar way, mainly using just the walk-tracking feature. Multilevel models revealed that both groups took significantly more steps during the 4-week study than during the week before downloading the app (\u03b3=0.24; P<.001). During the study, the participants in both groups averaged 5248 steps per day compared with an average of 3753 steps per day during the baseline week. Contrary to predictions, there were no differences in step increases between the two conditions. Cognition significantly improved from pre- to posttest (\u03b3=0.17; P=.02). Across conditions, on days in which the participants took more steps than average, they reported better mood and higher energy levels on the same day and better mood on the subsequent day. Daily associations among walking, mood, and energy were significant for women but not for men and were stronger for older participants (those aged \u226562 years) than for the younger participants.\nCONCLUSIONS: Both groups increased their steps to a similar extent, suggesting that setting and monitoring daily walking goals was sufficient for an initial increase and maintenance of steps. Across conditions, walking had benefits for positive mood and energy levels, particularly for women and older participants. Further investigations should identify other motivating factors that could lead to greater and more sustained increases in physical activity.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03124537; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03124537."

Analysis included 22,379 tests (16,278 treadmill and 6101 cycle ergometer) conducted between January 1, 1968, through March 31, 2021, from apparently healthy adults (aged 20 to 89 years). Percentiles of peak oxygen consumption for men and women were determined for each decade from 20 through 89 years of age for treadmill and cycle exercise modes, as well as when defining maximal effort as respiratory exchange ratio (RER) greater than or equal to 1.0 or RER greater than or equal to 1.1.\nRESULTS: For both men and women, the 50th percentile scores for each exercise mode decreased with age and were higher in men across all age groups and higher for treadmill compared with cycle CPX. The average rate of decline per decade over a 6-decade period was 13.5%, 4.0 mLO<sub>2</sub>\u00b7kg-1\u00b7min-1 for treadmill CPX and 16.4%, 4.3 mLO<sub>2</sub>\u00b7kg-1\u00b7min-1 for cycle CPX. Observationally, the mean peak oxygen consumption was similar whether using an RER criterion of greater than or equal to 1.0 or greater than or equal to 1.1 across the different test modes,\u00a0ages, and for both sexes. The updated reference standards for treadmill CPX were 1.5 - 4.6 mLO<sub>2</sub>\u00b7kg-1\u00b7min-1 lower compared with the previous 2015 standards whereas the updated cycling standards were generally comparable to the original 2017 standards.\nCONCLUSION: These updated cardiorespiratory fitness reference standards improve the representativeness of the US population compared with the original standards."

        "abstract_content": "BACKGROUND: The progression of Parkinson's Disease is variable, leading to a poor pharmacological response, as the effect of medication is reduced due to adaptation. Physical therapy is established as adjuvant treatment on physical conditions. The aim of this study was to monitor the level of physical fitness and anthropometric parameters of patients diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease, who had participated in physical exercise programs for 8-years.\nMETHODS: Seventy-one patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (53.50% males), mean age 71.19\u00b19.04 years old, with a mean disease stage of 2.52\u00b10.77 (Hoehn and Yahr Scale). All patients underwent an assessment of fitness and body composition at baseline (2011), 4-years, and 8-years.\nRESULTS: The study of the anthropometric parameters showed that throughout the 8 years of follow-up, the BMI has not undergone significant changes and shows a small upward trend for both men (0.30%, sig=0.938) and women (-0.10%, sig=0.817). This same behavior was reflected by the weight in men (1.36%, sig=0.315) and in women (-0.35%, sig=0.787). In terms of physical fitness, men showed a trend towards a deterioration in this parameter over the 8 years of follow-up (\u03a3Fitness=-1.82%, sig=0.930), while women showed a trend towards improvement (\u03a3Fitness=0.96%, sig=0.821). The same is recorded for strength and flexibility, where the data suggest that these are two of the variables that deteriorated the most over the 8 years of the study.\nCONCLUSIONS: After an 8-year follow-up, no significant changes in FC parameters affected by the progression of a neurodegenerative disease such as Parkinson's disease have been identified. The 8-foot up and go test has shown correlations with the other physical tests used."

        "abstract_content": "BACKGROUND: Higher muscle echo intensity (EI) reflects higher content of fat and/or connective tissue within skeletal muscle, eventually inducing lower muscle strength, physical dysfunction, and metabolic impairment. Continuous exercise decreases muscle EI in older individuals; however, it is not well understood how several months' rehabilitation exercise affects gradation-based EI. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of 6\u2009months of rehabilitation exercise on gradation-based higher and lower EI in older men and women.\nMETHODS: Twenty-seven men and women (7 men, 20 women; age, 75.6\u2009\u00b1\u20096.4\u2009years; height, 154.3\u2009\u00b1\u20098.5\u2009cm; weight, 55.8\u2009\u00b1\u20099.7\u2009kg) participated in this study. This study was a one-group before-and-after trial. They needed long-term care for activities of daily living. They performed rehabilitation exercises consisting of resistance exercises using a hydraulic resistance machine, stretching, and aerobic exercises using a recumbent bicycle once or twice a week for 6\u2009months. B-mode ultrasonographic transverse image was taken from thigh muscles, e.g., rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, and biceps femoris. We calculated gradation-based cross-sectional area (CSA) from thigh muscles by dividing 256 greyscale level to 10 different components levels (e.g., 0-24, 25-49, 50-74, \u2026, 200-224 and 225-249\u2009a.u.).\nRESULTS: Lowest EI (e.g., 0-24\u2009a.u.) CSA of thigh muscle was significantly increased after the exercise (0.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3 to 1.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8\u2009cm2; P\u2009&lt;\u20090.05). Middle to higher EI (e.g., 50-74, 75-99, 100-124, 125-149, 150-174, 175-199 and 200-224\u2009a.u.) CSAs were significantly decreased from 23.0 to 68.7% after the exercise (P\u2009&lt;\u20090.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: Several months' rehabilitation exercise affected both lower and higher EI in older men and women. This result suggests that rehabilitation exercise changes muscle composition by increasing contractile muscle tissue and decreasing fat and connective tissues."

        "abstract_content": "Examining participatory motives clarifies what engages and keeps individuals participating in exercise. The popularity of training at fitness centres has greatly increased over the last two decades, but individual determinants for motivation remain uncertain. This study compared motives between gender and age categories in training and performing physical activity at Norwegian fitness centres. To compare motives, a survey utilising a standardised questionnaire (MPAM-R) was conducted at six different Norwegian fitness centres. It was hypothesised that the intrinsic motive socialisation and extrinsic motive fitness would be more important among the older age categories for both genders, while the extrinsic motive appearance and intrinsic motive enjoyment would be more important among younger age groups. A total response of 183 men and 150 women, aged 14-80 years, was divided into seven categories based on their age and included in the statistical analysis. The main findings after conducting a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures, were that the most important motive for training at fitness centres was increasing fitness, followed by enjoyment, competence, vitality and appearance. The social motive was rated the lowest. Women rated fitness and enjoyment higher compared to men, and men rated the motive for appearance higher than women, but this decreased with age in both genders. With increasing age, the importance of enjoyment and competence decreased in men, while women seemed to place increased importance on vitality with age. The importance of the social motive decreased first as age increased, but then increased again in the age group 41-50 years and older. It was concluded that the motives for participating in exercise at fitness centres was dependent on individual characteristics and that motives about training at fitness centres differed by gender and changed with age."

        "abstract_content": "BACKGROUND: Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is the core element of health-related physical fitness evaluation. High pressure and low oxygen in Tibet (over 3,500 m above sea level) may negatively impact the residents' CRF. The 20-m shuttle run test (20mSRT) is the most popular field-based assessment and estimate of CRF in children and adolescents worldwide. However, normative CRF data for the children and adolescents residing in China's plateau region are unavailable, which prevents comparability among those living at high-altitudes around the world.\nPURPOSE: To measure the CRF of Chinese children and adolescents aged 9-18 years living in Tibet at altitudes exceeding 3,500 m, and to identify correlations between this metric and demographic characteristics (age, sex, and ethnicity). These data were then compared with those generated in the lowland (Shanghai, China) and various global regions.\nMETHODS: 20mSRT performance (number of completed laps) and predicted peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) were used as indicators of CRF. We measured the CRF of 1,717 healthy children and adolescents aged 9-18 years living in Tibet. The CRF data from school-age subjects in Shanghai (2,437 boys and 2,396 girls) and worldwide (1,142,026 students from 50 countries/regions in Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, North America, and Oceania) were collated from published papers.\nRESULTS: The average CRF of the participants from Tibet was 39.8 mL/kg/min. The male subjects (n = 876; 41.1 \u00b1 4.42 mL/kg/min) had a higher average CRF than their female counterparts (n = 841; 37.8 \u00b1 5.40 mL/kg/min). CRF decreased with age in both sexes at statistical significance (F = 1249.9, p for trend 0.05). The indigenous Tibetans (n = 1289; 40.1 \u00b1 3.71 mL/kg/min) had a significant higher average CRF than those of Han descent (n = 394; 38.9 \u00b1 4.70 mL/kg/min) (p < 0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: Children and adolescents aged 7-18 years residing above 3,500 m in Tibet displayed lower CRF traits compared with their counterparts from the plains area and other high altitude places. CRF varied according to age, sex, and ethnic group. Given the importance of CRF in children and adolescents, effective intervention strategies should be implemented to improve CRF in children and adolescents on the plateau."

The present study was carried out on 3374 healthy Caucasian, Polish men and women, clients of a sports clinic, mostly sportspeople, with a mean age of 36.57 years, body mass 74.54 kg, maximum oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub>max, ml\u2217kg-1 \u2217min-1) 50.07. Cardiopulmonary exercise tests (CPET) were carried out on treadmills or cycle ergometers to evaluate HRmax and VO<sub>2</sub>max. Linear, multiple linear, stepwise, Ridge and LASSO regression modeling were applied to establish the relationship between HRmax, age, fitness level, VO<sub>2</sub>max, body mass, age, testing modality and body mass index (BMI). Mean HRmax predictions calculated with 5 previously published formulae were evaluated in subgroups created according to all variables. HRmax was univariately explained by a 202.5-0.53\u2217age formula (R 2 = 19.18). The weak relationship may be explained by the similar age with small standard deviation (SD). Multiple linear regression, stepwise and LASSO yielded an R 2 of 0.224, while Ridge yielded R 2 0.20. Previously published formulae were less precise in the more outlying groups of the studied population, overestimating HRmax in older age groups and underestimating in younger. The 202.5-0.53\u2217age formula developed in the present study was the best in the studied population, yielding lowest mean errors in most groups, suggesting it could be used in more active individuals. Tanaka's formula offers the second best overall prediction, while the 220-age formula yields remarkably high mean errors of up to 9 bpm. In conclusion, adding the studied variables in multiple regression models improves the accuracy of prediction only slightly over age alone and is unlikely to be useful in clinical practice."

Thirty-four healthy untrained men aged 25-55 years were randomized to either a modified recreational volleyball group (MRV, n = 17) or a recreational volleyball group (RV, n = 17). Both groups performed volleyball training twice a week over 12 weeks, with participants in MRV playing a modified game with higher intensity due to shorter breaks between rallies. The small to moderate improvements of both groups were observed in SBP (MRV g <sub>av</sub> = -0.50 [-0.67, -0.33] vs. RV g <sub>av</sub> = -0.37 [-0.55, -0.20]) to a similar extent (p = 0.12).

        "abstract_content": "BACKGROUND: Declines in cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and fat-free mass (FFM) with age are linked to mortality, morbidity and poor quality of life. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) has been shown to improve CRF and FFM in many groups, but its efficacy in the very old, in whom comorbidities are present is undefined. We aimed to assess the efficacy of and physiological/metabolic responses to HIIT, in a cohort of octogenarians with comorbidities (e.g. hypertension and osteoarthritis).\nMETHODS: Twenty-eight volunteers (18 men, 10 women, 81.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6\u00a0years, 27.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6\u00a0kg\u00b7m-2 ) with American Society of Anaesthesiology (ASA) Grade 2-3 status each completed 4\u00a0weeks (12 sessions) HIIT after a control period of equal duration. Before and after each 4\u00a0week period, subjects underwent body composition assessments and cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Quadriceps muscle biopsies (m. vastus lateralis) were taken to quantify anabolic signalling, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, and cumulative muscle protein synthesis (MPS) over 4-weeks.\nRESULTS: In comorbid octogenarians, HIIT elicited improvements in CRF (anaerobic threshold: +1.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\u00a0ml\u00b7kg-1 \u00b7min-1 , P\u00a0=\u00a00.001). HIIT also augmented total FFM (47.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4 to 47.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3\u00a0kg, P\u00a0=\u00a00.04), while decreasing total fat mass (24.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3 to 24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2\u00a0kg, P\u00a0=\u00a00.0002) and body fat percentage (33.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5 to 32.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.0008). Mechanistically, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation capacity increased after HIIT (i.e. citrate synthase activity: 52.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 to 67.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.1\u00a0nmol\u00b7min-1 \u00b7mg-1 , P\u00a0=\u00a00.005; membrane protein complexes (C): C-II, 1.4-fold increase, P\u00a0=\u00a00.002; C-III, 1.2-fold increase, P\u00a0=\u00a00.03), as did rates of MPS (1.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1 to 1.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1%\u00b7day-1 , P\u00a0=\u00a00.03). The increase in MPS was supported by up-regulated phosphorylation of anabolic signalling proteins (e.g. AKT, p70S6K, and 4E-BP1; all P\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.05). There were no changes in any of these parameters during the control period. No adverse events were reported throughout the study.\nCONCLUSIONS: The HIIT enhances skeletal muscle mass and CRF in octogenarians with disease, with up-regulation of MPS and mitochondrial capacity likely underlying these improvements. HIIT can be safely delivered to octogenarians with disease and is an effective, time-efficient intervention to improve muscle mass and physical function in a short time frame."

        "abstract_content": "KEY POINTS: A hallmark trait of ageing skeletal muscle health is a reduction in size and function, which is most pronounced in the fast muscle fibres. We studied older men (74\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0years) with a history of lifelong (>50\u00a0years) endurance exercise to examine potential benefits for slow and fast muscle fibre size and contractile function. Lifelong endurance exercisers had slow muscle fibres that were larger, stronger, faster and more powerful than young exercisers (25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0years) and age-matched non-exercisers (75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0years). Limited benefits with lifelong endurance exercise were noted in the fast muscle fibres. These findings suggest that additional exercise modalities (e.g. resistance exercise) or other therapeutic interventions are needed to target fast muscle fibres with age.\nABSTRACT: We investigated single muscle fibre size and contractile function among three groups of men: lifelong exercisers (LLE) (n\u00a0=\u00a021, 74\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0years), old healthy non-exercisers (OH) (n\u00a0=\u00a010, 75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0years) and young exercisers (YE) (n\u00a0=\u00a010, 25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0years). On average, LLE had exercised \u223c5 days\u00a0week-1 for \u223c7 h\u00a0week-1 over the past 53\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06\u00a0years. LLE were subdivided based on lifelong exercise intensity into performance (LLE-P) (n\u00a0=\u00a014) and fitness (LLE-F) (n\u00a0=\u00a07). Muscle biopsies (vastus lateralis) were examined for myosin heavy chain (MHC) slow (MHC I) and fast (MHC IIa) fibre size and function (strength, speed, power). LLE MHC I size (7624\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02765\u00a0\u03bcm2 ) was 25-40% larger (P\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.001) than YE (6106\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01710\u00a0\u03bcm2 ) and OH (5476\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02467\u00a0\u03bcm2 ). LLE MHC I fibres were \u223c20% stronger, \u223c10% faster and \u223c30% more powerful than YE and OH (P\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.05). By contrast, LLE MHC IIa size (6466\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02659\u00a0\u03bcm2 ) was similar to OH (6237\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02525\u00a0\u03bcm2 ; P\u00a0=\u00a00.854), with both groups \u223c20% smaller (P\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.001) than YE (7860\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01930\u00a0\u03bcm2 ). MHC IIa contractile function was variable across groups, with a hierarchical pattern (OH &gt; LLE &gt; YE; P\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.05) in normalized power among OH (16.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.4\u00a0W\u00a0L-1 ), LLE (13.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.5\u00a0W\u00a0L-1 ) and YE (12.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.5\u00a0W\u00a0L-1 ). The LLE-P and LLE-F had similar single fibre profiles with MHC I power driven by speed (LLE-P) or force (LLE-F), suggesting exercise intensity impacted slow muscle fibre mechanics. These data suggest that lifelong endurance exercise benefited slow muscle fibre size and function. Comparable fast fibre characteristics between LLE and OH, regardless of training intensity, suggest other exercise modes (e.g. resistance training) or myotherapeutics may be necessary to preserve fast muscle fibre size and performance with age."

However, the influence of the type of voluntary PA as well as age or sex in this relationship is unclear. Thus, we assess the association between current and past PA level and physical performances among voluntary active older adults.\nMETHODS: Functional capacities (timed Up and Go, sit-to-stand, alternate step test, unipodal balance, grip strength, knee extension strength, estimated muscle power and VO2 max) as well as body composition (DXA: total and appendicular lean masses (LM; kg), fat mass (FM; %)) were measured. Current and last 5-years PA level (time spent on total, aerobic, resistance and body & mind activities) were assessed using an interview. Multiple regressions, adjusted on age, sex and BMI, were performed to assess the relationship between current or past PA level and physical performances. Sub-group analysis, according to the sex (men/women) or age (<\u200965\u2009yrs. vs. \u226565\u2009yrs) were performed.\nRESULTS: 525 subjects (age:61.7\u2009\u00b1\u20098.1\u2009yrs.; women:68.9%; BMI:26.4\u2009\u00b1\u20094.8\u2009kg/m2) were enrolled in this study. After adjustment on confounding factors, total current PA level has positive impact on total FM (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-\u20092.09, p\u2009=\u20090004) and balance (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.10; p\u2009=\u20090.05). Moreover, current body &amp; mind activities influence total LBM (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.22, p\u2009=\u20090.02) and balance (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.17; p\u2009=\u20090.001) whereas resistance activities influence total LBM (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.17; p\u2009=\u20090.05), FM (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.16; p\u2009=\u20090.04) and sit-to-stand capacities (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.10; p\u2009=\u00a00.05). Globally, these results were more pronounced in women than in men and among people aged over 65\u2009years. Past level of PA has low impact on functional capacities and body composition, regardless of sex. Among people &lt;\u200965\u2009years, there is no relationship between time spent on total PA and functional capacities or body composition. However, a significant correlation was found between past total PA and balance (r=`\u00a00.19; p\u2009=\u20090.01), alternate-step test (r\u2009=\u00a00.24; p\u2009=\u20090.02) and VO2max (r\u2009=\u00a00.19; p\u2009=\u00a00.02) in people aged over 65\u2009years. More precisely, the past time spent on aerobic and resistance activities influence balance (r\u2009=\u00a00.16; p\u2009=\u20090.03 and r\u2009=\u00a00.15; p\u2009=\u20090.04, respectively) after 65\u2009yrs. old.\nCONCLUSION: Even if physical activity history has little influence on physical aging process, being active is associated with body composition and functional capacities, especially among women aged 65\u2009years and over."

For biomarker analysis, blood samples were collected before, and 5 and 30\u2009min after exercise. Samples for vitamin D levels were collected before exercise. N-terminal propeptide of type I collagen (PINP) was analysed as a marker of bone formation. C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) was analysed as a marker of bone resorption.\nRESULTS: UBWT fitness readings were better in the EG group than in the PAM group, with no difference in LBWT readings between the groups. UBWT mean power was 8.8% higher in subjects with 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> levels over 22.50\u2009ng/ml and in those with 24,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> levels over 1.27\u2009ng/ml. Serum CTX levels increased after both tests in the PAM group, with no change in the EG group. PINP levels did not change in either group; however, in PAM subjects with 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> levels above the median, they were higher than those in EG subjects.\nCONCLUSION: Vitamin D metabolites affect the anaerobic performance and bone turnover markers at rest and after exercise. Further, adaptation to physical activity modulates the effect of anaerobic exercise on bone metabolism markers."

        "year": 2021,
        "abstract_content": "CONTEXT: The physiological determinants of ultramarathon success have rarely been assessed and likely differ in their contributions to performance as race distance increases.\nPURPOSE: To examine predictors of performance in athletes who completed either a 50-, 80-, or 160-km trail race over a 20-km loop course on the same day.\nMETHODS: Measures of running history, aerobic fitness, running economy, body mass loss, hematocrit alterations, age, and cardiovascular health were examined in relation to race-day performance. Performance was defined as the percentage difference from the winning time at a given race distance, with 0% representing the fastest possible time.\nRESULTS: In the 50-km race, training volumes, cardiovascular health, aerobic fitness, and a greater loss of body mass during the race were all related to better performance (all P < .05). Using multiple linear regression, peak velocity achieved in the maximal oxygen uptake test (\u03b2 = -11.7, P = .002) and baseline blood pressure (\u03b2 = 3.1, P = .007) were the best performance predictors for the men's 50-km race (r = .98, r2 = .96, P < .001), while peak velocity achieved in the maximal oxygen uptake test (\u03b2 = -13.6, P = .001) and loss of body mass (\u03b2 = 12.8, P = .03) were the best predictors for women (r = .94, r2 = .87, P = .001). In the 80-km race, only peak velocity achieved in the maximal oxygen uptake test predicted performance (\u03b2 = -20.3, r = .88, r2 = .78, P < .001). In the 160-km race, there were no significant performance determinants.\nCONCLUSIONS: While classic determinants of running performance, including cardiovascular health and running fitness, predict 50-km trail-running success, performance in longer-distance races appears to be less influenced by such physiological parameters."

Individual responses estimated using 50% confidence intervals derived from the technical error were interpreted against a smallest worthwhile change of 1.75 mL\u00b7kg-1\u00b7min-1. The standard deviation of individual responses was 2.39 mL\u00b7kg-1\u00b7min-1 demonstrating clinically meaningful heterogeneity in training-induced changes in V\u0307O<sub>2max</sub> following REHIT that exceed the technical, biological and random within-subjects variability of V\u0307O<sub>2max</sub> assessment. The likely (75% probability) non-response rate was 18% (21/117), and 49% (57/117) of individuals demonstrated increases in V\u0307O<sub>2max</sub> likely higher than the smallest worthwhile change. We conclude that the well-described increase in V\u0307O<sub>2max</sub> following REHIT at the group level is subject to substantial variability in magnitude at an individual level. This has important implications for exercise prescription and can be harnessed to elucidate mechanisms of adaptation.

However, little is known in regards to how CRF has trended in apparently healthy adults over the past several decades.\nPURPOSE: To analyze trends in CRF and CVD risk factors over the last 50 years in a population of apparently healthy adult men and women.\nMETHODS: Participants were 4,214 apparently healthy adults (2,390 men and 1,824 women) from the Ball State Adult Fitness Longitudinal Lifestyle STudy (BALL ST) that performed maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing between 1970-2019 for the assessment of CRF defined as VO2max (ml/kg/min). Participants were self-referred either to a community-based exercise program, fitness testing, or were research subjects in exercise related studies and were placed into groups by decade based on testing date.\nRESULTS: CRF showed a general trend to decline (P<0.05) from the 1970s to the 2000s with an increase (P<0.05) from the 2000s to the 2010s for both men and women. This pattern persisted for age and sex-adjusted CRF level, determined by Fitness Registry and the Importance of Exercise: A National Data Base (FRIEND). For both women and men, CRF across the decades was associated (P<0.05) with the prevalence of physical inactivity, smoking, obesity, dyslipidemia and hypertension, and with diabetes in men only.\nCONCLUSION: CRF declined from 1970 through the 2000s in a cohort of apparently healthy men and women which was associated with worsening CVD risk profiles. However, the decline in CRF was attenuated over the past decade which may have a positive impact on future CVD in the population. Promoting physical activity to increase CRF should be a primary aspect of CVD prevention programs."

Yet, PA takes place in different domains (i.e., sports-related physical activity [SPA], leisure time related physical activity [LTPA], and work-related physical activity [WPA]) and not all domain-specific PA may help to maintain high CRF levels throughout life. We assessed the relationship between changes in domain-specific PA and the age-related decline in CRF. We analyzed data of 353 men (median age 50\u00a0years; inter-quartile range [IQR] 40 to 60) and 335 women (median age 50\u00a0years; IQR 41 to 59) with data for domain-specific PA as well as CRF testing measured ten years apart. CRF was assessed with cardiorespiratory exercise testing. Domain-specific PA was measured using the Baecke questionnaire. During the 10-year follow-up, CRF decreased in men from 29.3 (IQR 25.0 to 34.7) mL/min/kg to 24.3 (IQR 20.8 to 27.3) mL/min/kg. In women, CRF declined from 26.0 (IQR 21.0 to 30.9) to 21.4 (IQR 18.3 to 25.6) mL/min/kg. A one point higher SPA at baseline was related to a 1.14 (95% confidence interval [CI] -1.50 to -0.53) mL/min/kg greater decrease in VO<sub>2peak</sub> . A one point greater SPA and LTPA over time was associated with a 1.68 (95% CI 1.06 to 2.29) mL/min/kg and 1.24 (95% CI 0.57 to 1.90) mL/min/kg lower decrease in VO<sub>2peak</sub> , respectively. Neither baseline values nor changes of WPA were associated with CRF. Sports and leisure time related PA may attenuate the age-related decline in CRF."

Different studies have shown the importance of sports service and human resources for greater customer loyalty. However, few works have studied how the physical environment or servicescape influences the behavior of consumers in fitness centers based on gender and age. Therefore, the objective of the study was to analyze the relationship between servicescape and the loyalty of fitness center consumers, analyzing through the Importance-Performance Matrix Analysis (IPMA) what the aspects to improve according to gender and age are. The sample was 10,368 fitness center customers (5864 women and 4504 men). After the IPMA, it was concluded that the main improvement margins in general in fitness centers were the equipment and the facility condition, and the facility layout. In turn, in relation to gender and age, the aspects with room for improvement were to a greater extent for equipment and facility condition in women over 21 years of age, and in facility layout for women between 21 and 40 years old and 51-60 years old. Regarding men, the aspects with the highest performance margins were the equipment and facility condition in all the age groups, the facility layout in men up to 50 years old, and the signage in men up to 40 years old and from 51 to 60 years old."

Hispanics have a 50% higher type 2 diabetes (T2DM) death rate compared to non-Hispanic whites, yet low participation in lifestyle change programs, making this subgroup an important target for prevention efforts. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of an exercise intervention implementing the Center for Disease Control and Prevention National Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP) plus recreational soccer (RS) in Hispanic men.\nMETHODS: Overweight and obese Hispanic men, aged 30-57\u00a0years with prediabetes at screening were recruited from the community. Trained soccer coaches led 30-min facilitated discussion of the NDPP modules after each RS session, with two weekly sessions delivered over 12 wks, then once a wk until 24 wks. The 1-h RS sessions followed the Football Fitness curriculum structure. Standardized study assessments included objectively measured physical activity via fitness tracker, physical fitness via validated field tests, global positional system soccer specific metrics and behavior change questionnaires. Mixed models assessed the outcomes as a function of time and cohort and incorporated an unstructured covariance structure to examine the difference between baseline, 12 and 24 wks. All analyses were conducted as intent-to-treat and generated using SAS v 9.4.\nRESULTS: Hispanic males (n\u00a0=\u00a041; mean age 41.9 [6.2 SD] years) were obese at baseline (mean BMI 32.7, standard error [0.7]). After 24 wks of the NDPP+RS intervention, there were significant beneficial changes in vertical jump (2.8 [1.3] cm; p\u00a0=\u00a00.048), agility and lower extremity muscular power (figure 8-run) at 12 wks (-4.7% change; p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and 24 wks (-7.2% change; p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.0001), predicted VO<sub>2</sub> max (12 wks: 1.9%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.007; 24 wks 1.0%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.036), modified push-ups increased 22% (p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.0001) at 12 wks and 31% (p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.0001) at 24 wks, dynamic sit-ups increased 10% (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005) at 12 wks and 15% (p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.0001) at 24 wks.\nCONCLUSION: Among middle-aged Latino men, broad-ranging significant improvements in physical fitness were observed after 24 wks participating in lifestyle education plus RS in a single arm feasibility trial."

Grip strength, vertical jump, single-leg balance with eyes closed, forward bending, and whole-body reaction time were evaluated at baseline. Dyslipidemia was annually determined based on fasting serum lipid profiles and self-reported dyslipidemia from April 2001 to March 2008.\nRESULTS: During the follow-up period, 4,458 (44.9%) men and 2,461 (39.6%) women developed dyslipidemia. A higher relative grip strength (grip strength/body mass index) was associated with a lower incidence of dyslipidemia among both men and women (P for trend <0.001). Compared with those for the first septile, the hazards ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the seventh septile were 0.56 (95% CI, 0.50-0.63) for men and 0.69 (95% CI, 0.58-0.81) for women. Moreover, relative vertical jump (vertical jump strength/body mass index) was also inversely associated with the incidence of dyslipidemia among both men and women (P for trend <0.001).

It can be resolved, and its complications reduced, by lifestyle interventions offered in primary care. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the impact of the exercise program of the CHANGE feasibility study on physical fitness and physical activity habits, and assess associations between changes in MetS components and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF).\nMETHODS: In this analysis of 192 of the 293 adults with MetS in the overall study, the impact on physical fitness [aerobic capacity, muscular fitness and flexibility], and non-supervised physical activities was investigated over 12\u2009months. In the CHANGE program, aerobic capacity, muscular fitness and flexibility were assessed at baseline, after 3\u2009months of weekly supervised exercise, and following 9 additional months during which participants had one monthly session of supervised exercise. Additionally, CRF response was also examined in relation to changes in MetS components [fasting glucose, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, blood pressure, waist circumference (WC)].\nRESULTS: Fitness variables were significantly increased at 12\u2009months with most of the improvements reached by 3\u2009months (estimated VO<sub>2</sub> max: 6 and 12%; partial curl-ups: 55 and 80%; push-ups: 50 and 100%; flexibility: 22 and 10% in men and women, respectively, p\u2009&lt;\u2009\u00a00.001). As expected, the duration and intensity of supervised aerobic physical activity increased during the first 3\u2009months of supervision in both men and women, and remained unchanged for the duration of the program. The duration of non-supervised physical activities did not change during the program in men whereas an increase in manual work of moderate intensity was recorded in women between 3 and 12\u2009months. In women, mean changes in WC were significantly greater among high VO<sub>2</sub> max responders than low responders, between 0 and 12\u2009months, as well as between 3 and 12\u2009months (-\u20093.42\u2009cm and\u2009-\u20094.32\u2009cm, respectively, p\u2009&lt;\u2009\u00a00.05). No associations were seen with MetS components in men. Higher intensity activities were maintained by both sexes at one year.\nCONCLUSION: Patients with MetS participating in the CHANGE lifestyle program improved physical fitness and physical activity habits by three months and maintained these gains over one year. Women who achieved a greater VO<sub>2</sub> max increase had greater reductions in WC compared to low VO<sub>2</sub>max responders."

For other CVD risk factors, numerous genetic association studies have been performed, revealing promising risk markers and new therapeutic targets. However, large genomic association studies on VO<sub>2max</sub> are still lacking, despite the fact that VO<sub>2max</sub> has a large genetic component.\nMETHODS: We performed a genetic association study on 123.545 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and directly measured VO<sub>2max</sub> in 3470 individuals (exploration cohort). Candidate SNPs from the exploration cohort were analyzed in a validation cohort of 718 individuals, in addition to 7 wild-card SNPs. Sub-analyses were performed for each gender. Validated SNPs were used to create a genetic score for VO<sub>2max</sub>. In silico analyses and genotype-phenotype databases were used to predict physiological function of the SNPs.\nRESULTS: In the exploration cohort, 41 SNPs were associated with VO<sub>2max</sub> (p\u00a0&lt;\u00a05.0\u00a0\u2217\u00a010-4). Six of the candidate SNPs were associated with VO<sub>2max</sub> also in the validation cohort, in addition to three wild-card SNPs (p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.05, in men, women or both). The cumulative number of high-VO<sub>2max</sub><sub>-</sub>SNPs correlated negatively with CVD risk factors, e.g. waist-circumference, visceral fat, fat %, cholesterol levels and BMI. In silico analysis indicated that several of the VO<sub>2max</sub>-SNPs influence gene expression in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and heart.\nCONCLUSION: We discovered and validated new SNPs associated with VO<sub>2max</sub> and proposed possible links between VO<sub>2max</sub> and CVD. Studies combining several large cohorts with directly measured VO<sub>2max</sub> are needed to identify more SNPs associated with this phenotype."

Upper and lower body muscle strength and physical function were assessed at baseline, 6 and 12 months.\nRESULTS: There was a significant difference for all strength measures at 6 months favouring IMX (P\u2009<\u20090.001), with net differences in leg press, seated row and chest press strength of 19.9\u2009kg (95% CI, 12.3-27.5\u2009kg), 5.6\u2009kg (3.8-7.4\u2009kg) and 4.3\u2009kg (2.7-5.8\u2009kg), respectively. From 7 to 12 months, DEL increased in all strength measures (P\u2009<\u20090.001), with no differences between groups at 12 months. Similarly, physical function improved (P\u2009<\u20090.001) in IMX compared with DEL at 6 months for the 6-m fast walk (-0.2, 95% CI -0.3 to -0.1\u2009s), 400-m walk (-9.7, -14.8 to -4.6\u2009s), stair climb (-0.4, -0.6 to -0.2\u2009s) and chair rise (-1.0, -1.4 to -0.7\u2009s), with no differences between groups by 12 months, except for the 6-m fast walk (P\u2009<\u20090.001).\nCONCLUSION: Exercise either at the onset or after 6 months of ADT preserves/enhances muscle strength and physical function. However, to avoid initial treatment-related adverse effects on strength and function, exercise therapy should be implemented with initiation of ADT."

Multivariable Cox regression was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs of the relationships between physical activity with incidence of 15 types of cancer. Dose-response relationships were modeled with restricted cubic spline functions that compared 7.5, 15.0, 22.5, and 30.0 MET hours/week to no leisure-time physical activity, and statistically significant associations were determined using tests for trend (P &lt; .05) and 95% CIs (&lt; 1.0).\nRESULTS: A total of 755,459 participants (median age, 62 years [range, 32-91 years]; 53% female) were followed for 10.1 years, and 50,620 incident cancers accrued. Engagement in recommended amounts of activity (7.5-15 MET hours/week) was associated with a statistically significant lower risk of 7 of the 15 cancer types studied, including colon (8%-14% lower risk in men), breast (6%-10% lower risk), endometrial (10%-18% lower risk), kidney (11%-17% lower risk), myeloma (14%-19% lower risk), liver (18%-27% lower risk), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (11%-18% lower risk in women). The dose response was linear in shape for half of the associations and nonlinear for the others. Results for moderate- and vigorous-intensity leisure-time physical activity were mixed. Adjustment for body mass index eliminated the association with endometrial cancer but had limited effect on other cancer types.\nCONCLUSION: Health care providers, fitness professionals, and public health practitioners should encourage adults to adopt and maintain physical activity at recommended levels to lower risks of multiple cancers."

Young exercisers [YE; n = 20, 10 women (W), 25\u2009\u00b1\u20091 yr], lifelong exercisers (LLE; n = 28, 7 W, 74\u2009\u00b1\u20092 yr), and old healthy nonexercisers (OH; n = 20, 10 W, 75\u2009\u00b1\u20091 yr) were studied. On average, LLE exercised 5 days/wk for 7 h/wk over the past 52\u2009\u00b1\u20091 yr. The LLE men were subdivided by exercise intensity [Performance (LLE-P), n = 14; Fitness (LLE-F), n = 7]. Upper and lower leg muscle size and adiposity [intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT)] were determined via MRI, and quadriceps isotonic and isometric function was assessed. For the quadriceps, aging decreased muscle size, isotonic and isometric strength, contraction velocity (men only), and power (P &lt; 0.05). In women, LLE did not influence muscle size or function. In men, LLE attenuated the decline in muscle size and isometric strength by ~50% (P &lt; 0.05). LLE did not influence other aspects of muscle function, nor did training intensity influence muscle size or function. For the triceps surae, aging decreased muscle size only in the women, whereas LLE (both sexes) and training intensity (LLE men) did not influence muscle size. In both sexes, aging increased thigh and calf IMAT by ~130% (P &lt; 0.05), whereas LLE attenuated the thigh increase by ~50% (P &lt; 0.05). In the LLE men, higher training intensity decreased thigh and calf IMAT by ~30% (P &lt; 0.05). In summary, aging and lifelong aerobic exercise influenced muscle size, function, and adipose tissue infiltration in a sex- and muscle-specific fashion. Higher training intensity throughout the life span provided greater protection against adipose tissue infiltration into muscle.NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY This is the first study to examine skeletal muscle size, function, and adiposity in women and men in their eighth decade of life that have engaged in lifelong aerobic exercise. The findings reveal sex and upper and lower leg muscle group-specific benefits related to skeletal muscle size, function, and adiposity and that exercise intensity influences intermuscular adiposity. This emerging cohort will further our understanding of the health implications of maintaining exercise throughout the life span."

We studied this association in a socioeconomically homogenous cohort of businessmen.\nMETHODS: The study consists of men (n\u2009=\u2009970) from the Helsinki Businessmen Study cohort (born 1919-1928). Five major cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors (smoking, BMI, blood pressure, serum lipids, fasting glucose), consumption of alcohol and coffee, self-rated health and self-rated fitness, were assessed in 1974, at an average age of 50\u00a0years. The number of major risk factors was tested as a risk burden. The Charlson Comorbidity Index and the RAND-36 (SF-36) Physical and Mental health summary scores were calculated from surveys in year 2000, at age of 73\u00a0years. Mortality dates were retrieved through 31 March 2018 from the Population Information System of Finland.\nRESULTS: 244\u00a0men survived to the age of 90 representing 25.2% of the study cohort. The survivors had less risk factor burden in midlife, and less morbidity and higher physical health summary score in 2000. Of those with five major risk factors only 7% survived up to 90\u00a0years, whereas 51% of those without any risk factors reached that age. Single risk factors reducing odds of reaching 90\u00a0years were smoking (odds ratio [OR] 0.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.34-0.67), glucose (0.66, 0.49-0.88), BMI (0.63, 0.46-0.86), and cholesterol (0.71, 0.53-0.96).\nCONCLUSION: Lack of five major CVD risk factors in midlife strongly increased odds of reaching 90\u00a0years of age and also predicted factors related to successful ageing in late life."

While upper-body Moderate Intensity Continuous Training (MICT) improves cardiorespiratory fitness, its effects on cardiometabolic component risks in adults with SCI appear relatively modest. The aim of this study is to assess the acute effects of Continuous Resistance Training (CRT), High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), MICT and rest (CON) on fasting and postprandial systemic biomarkers and substrate utilisation.\nMETHODS: Eleven healthy, chronic SCI (>\u20091\u2009year, ASIA A-C) men will be recruited. Following preliminary testing, each will complete four experimental conditions, where they will report to the laboratory following an ~\u200910-h overnight fast. A venous blood sample will be drawn and expired gases collected to estimate resting metabolic rate (RMR). In order to ensure an isocaloric exercise challenge, each will complete CRT first, with the remaining three conditions presented in randomised order: (1) CRT, ~\u200945\u2009min of resistance manoeuvres (weight lifting) interspersed with low-resistance, high-speed arm-crank exercise; (2) CON, seated rest; (3) MICT, ~\u200945\u2009min constant arm-crank exercise at a resistance equivalent to 30-40% peak power output (PPO) and; (4) HIIT, ~\u200935\u2009min arm-crank exercise with the resistance alternating every 2\u2009min between 10% PPO and 70% PPO. After each ~\u200945-min condition, participants will ingest a 2510-kJ liquid test meal (35% fat, 50% carbohydrate, 15% protein). Venous blood and expired gas samples will be collected at the end of exercise and at regular intervals for 120\u2009min post meal.\nDISCUSSION: This study should establish the acute effects of different forms of exercise on fasting and postprandial responses in chronic SCI male patients. Measures of glucose clearance, insulin sensitivity, lipid and inflammatory biomarker concentrations will be assessed and changes in whole-body substrate oxidation estimated from expired gases.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: NCT03545867 .

The present study was carried out using data from the 2008 and 2011 Living Profiles of Older People Survey. A total of 14,122 participants aged 60 years and older (57% women) completed the 2008 baseline and 2011 follow-up assessments (i.e., socioeconomic status, health behaviors and conditions, and prevalence of chronic diseases), and they were included for the final analyses. CRF was estimated (eCRF) with sex-specific algorithms and classified as lower (lowest 25%), middle (middle 50%), and upper (highest 25%). Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) across eCRF categories. In total, multivariable-adjusted HRs and 95% CIs were 1 for the upper eCRF group (referent), 1.059 (0.814~1.378) for the middle eCRF group, and 1.714 (1.304~2.253) for the lower eCRF group. In men, multivariable-adjusted HRs and 95% CIs were 1 for the upper eCRF group (referent), 1.011 (0.716~1.427) for the middle eCRF group, and 1.566 (1.098~2.234) for the lower eCRF group. In women, multivariable-adjusted HRs and 95% CIs were 1 for the upper eCRF group (referent), 1.064 (0.707~1.602) for the middle eCRF group, and 1.599 (1.032~2.478) for the lower eCRF group. The current findings suggest that eCRF may have an independent predictor of all-cause mortality, underscoring the importance of promoting physical activity to maintain a healthful level of CRF in Korean geriatric population."

Fourteen trained men (24.05 \u00b1 4.17 yrs, 78.85 \u00b1 3.51 kg, 175.42 \u00b1 4.01 cm) underwent two different training sequences (SEQ1 and SEQ2). In SEQ1, all subjects performed 5 sets for maximal repetitions, with a 2-min rest interval, of the bench press followed by the machine chest fly with 10 repetitions maximum load. In SEQ2, the same procedures were repeated, but with the reverse order. The t-test did not show any differences (p = 0.140) in total workout repetitions between SEQ1 (62.22 \u00b1 11.00 repetitions) and SEQ2 (55.40 \u00b1 8.51 repetitions).

In contrast, the total repetition number for the machine chest fly exercise following SEQ2 was significantly greater (p = 0.001) (33.50 + 4.11 repetitions) compared to SEQ1 (27.85 \u00b1 6.52 repetitions). Despite no significant differences found for the rating of perceived exertion (RPE) values between SEQ1 and SEQ2 for the barbell bench press in all sets (p \u2265 0.083), significantly higher RPE values for the machine chest fly were observed over the first three sets following SEQ1 compared to SEQ2 (p < 0.01). In conclusion, the total workout repetitions were not significantly different when performing the traditional multi- to single-joint or the reverse exercise order when training the pectoralis major muscle."

Whether the association between isolated low HDL-C and mortality differs by fitness is uncertain. Patients in the Henry Ford ExercIse Testing Project (FIT Project) completed a physician-referred treadmill stress test and those prescribed lipid-lowering medications or with known cardiovascular disease were excluded. Isolated low HDL-C was defined as HDL-C <40 mg/dl for men and <50 mg/dl for women with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides <100 mg/dl (n\u202f=\u202f688). An optimal lipid panel was defined as HDL-C \u226540 mg/dl for men and \u226550 mg/dl for women with LDL-C and triglycerides <100 mg/dl (n\u202f=\u202f2,923). Mortality was ascertained through Social Security Death Index linkage. Patients with isolated low HDL-C had a mean age of 48.9 \u00b1 12.9 years and 62.9% were women. Over a mean follow-up of 10.3 \u00b1 5 years, 12.8% of patients with isolated low HDL-C and 8.7% with optimal lipids died. Compared to individuals with optimal lipids, those with isolated low HDL-C who achieved <6 METs had a lower survival (p\u202f=\u202f0.02), whereas there was no mortality difference for those who achieved 6 to 10 METs (p\u202f=\u202f0.13) or \u226510 METs (p\u202f=\u202f0.66). In adjusted Cox models, the mortality hazard for those with isolated low HDL-C compared with optimal lipids was 1.73 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18 to 2.54), 1.90 (95% CI 1.19 to 3.04), and 0.97 (95% CI 0.53 to 1.78) for the METS categories of <6, 6 to 10, and \u226510.

The present study aims to assess whether change of fitness over time has any impact on long-term risk of stroke and death. Methods- We recruited healthy men aged 40 to 59 years in 1972 to 1975, and followed them until 2007. Physical fitness was assessed with a bicycle ECG test at baseline and again at 7 years, by dividing the total exercise work by body weight. Participants were categorized as remained fit, became unfit, remained unfit, or became fit, depending on whether fitness remained or crossed the median values from baseline to the 7-year visit. Outcome data were collected up to 35 years, from study visits, hospital records, and the National Cause of Death Registry. Risks of stroke and death were estimated by Cox regression analyses and expressed as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs. Results- Of 2014 participants, 1403 were assessed both at baseline and again at 7 years, and were followed for a mean of 23.6 years. Compared with the became unfit group, risk of stroke was 0.85 (0.54-1.36) for the remained unfit, 0.43 (0.28-0.67) for the remained fit, and 0.34 (0.17-0.67) for the became fit group. For all-cause death, risks were 0.99 (0.76-1.29), 0.57 (0.45-0.74), and 0.65 (0.46-0.90), respectively. Among those with high fitness at baseline, the became unfit group had a significantly higher risk of stroke (HR, 2.35; CI, 1.49-3.63) and death (HR, 1.74; CI, 1.35-2.23) than those who remained fit. Among those who had low fitness at baseline, the became fit group had a significantly lower risk of stroke (HR, 0.40; CI, 0.21-0.72) and death (HR, 0.66; CI, 0.50-0.85) than participants in the remained unfit group. Conclusions- Cardiorespiratory fitness at baseline and change in fitness was associated with large changes in long-term risk of stroke and death. These findings support the encouragement of regular exercise as a stroke prevention strategy."

However, this relationship has almost exclusively been studied using estimated CRF.\nOBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the association of directly measured CRF, obtained using cardiopulmonary exercise (CPX) testing with all-cause, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancer mortality in apparently healthy men and women.\nMETHODS: Participants included 4,137 self-referred apparently healthy adults (2,326 men, 1,811 women; mean age: 42.8 \u00b1 12.2 years) who underwent CPX testing to determine baseline CRF. Participants were followed for 24.2 \u00b1 11.7 years (1.1 to 49.3 years) for mortality. Cox-proportional hazard models were performed to determine the relationship of CRF (ml\u00b7kg-1\u00b7min-1) and CRF level (low, moderate, and high) with mortality outcomes.\nRESULTS: During follow-up, 727 participants died (524 men, 203 women). CPX-derived CRF was inversely related to all-cause, CVD, and cancer mortality. Low CRF was associated with higher risk for all-cause (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.20 to 3.50), CVD (HR: 2.27; 95% CI: 1.20 to 3.49), and cancer (HR: 2.07; 95% CI: 1.18 to 3.36) mortality compared with high CRF. Further, each metabolic equivalent increment increase in CRF was associated with a 11.6%, 16.1%, and 14.0% reductions in all-cause, CVD, and cancer mortality, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: Given the prognostic ability of CPX-derived CRF for all-cause and disease-specific mortality outcomes, its use should be highly considered for apparently healthy populations as it may help to improve the efficacy of the individualized patient risk assessment and guide clinical decisions."

However, the influence of hypoxia on an acute session has been barely studied. The aim of this study was to evaluate the acute effects of an intermittent hypoxic resistance training (IHRT) to muscle failure on bench press performance.\nMETHODS: A randomized crossover design was performed, and 25 untrained men performed a resistance training under two different conditions: normoxia (FIO2=21%) and high-level hypoxia (FIO2=13%). Resistance training consisted of 3 sets of 75% 1RM to muscle failure, with a 2-minute rest between sets. Physical performance was assessed by quantifying total repetitions, concentric velocity and power variable during all sets. Arterial oxygen saturation, heart rate, rating of perceived exertion (RPE), capillary blood lactate and muscle soreness were also assessed after training.\nRESULTS: Physical performance during bench press did not differ under hypoxic conditions (P>0.05). However, there were significant increases (P<0.05) of RPE (from 7.5\u00b10.8 to 7.9\u00b10.8) and blood lactate concentrations (from 5.5\u00b11.2 to 6.2\u00b11.5 mmol/L) in the hypoxia group.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that hypoxic resistance exercise does not affect exercise performance during bench press exercise. However, influence to perceived exercise intensity and blood lactate concentrations, suggesting that hypoxic resistance training may add substantially to the training dose experienced."

Weekly PAI scores assessed at a single point in time were found to associate with lower risk of premature cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in the general healthy population. However, to date, the associations between long-term longitudinal changes in weekly PAI scores and mortality have not been explored.\nPURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to prospectively examine the association between change in weekly PAI scores estimated 10\u202fyears apart, and risk of mortality from CVD and all-causes.\nMETHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of 11,870 men and 13,010 women without known CVD in Norway. By using data from the Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag Health Study (HUNT), PAI was estimated twice, ten years apart (HUNT1 1984-86 and HUNT2 1995-97). Mortality was followed-up until December 31, 2015. Adjusted hazard ratios (AHR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for death from CVD and all-causes related to temporal changes in PAI were estimated using Cox regression analyses.\nRESULTS: During a mean (SD) of 18 (4) years of follow-up, there were 4782 deaths, including 1560 deaths caused by CVD. Multi-adjusted analyses demonstrated that participants achieving a score of \u2265100 PAI at both time points had 32% lower risk of CVD mortality (AHR 0.68; CI: 0.54-0.86) for CVD mortality and 20% lower risk of all-cause mortality (AHR 0.80; CI: 71-0.91) compared with participants obtaining <100 weekly PAI at both measurements. For participants having <100 PAI in HUNT1 but \u2265100 PAI in HUNT2, the AHRs were 0.87 (CI: 0.74-1.03) for CVD mortality, and 0.86 (CI: 0.79-0.95) for all-cause mortality. We also found an inverse linear relationship between change in PAI and risk of CVD mortality among participants with 0 PAI (P\u202f<\u202f0.01), and \u226450 PAI (P\u202f=\u202f0.04) in HUNT1, indicating that an increase in PAI over time is associated with lower risk of mortality. Excluding the first three years of follow-up did not substantially alter the findings. Increasing PAI score from <100 PAI in HUNT1 to \u2265100 PAI in HUNT2 was associated with 6.6\u202fyears gained lifespan.\nCONCLUSION: Among men and women without known CVD, an increase in PAI score and sustained high PAI score over a 10-year period was associated with lower risk of mortality."

LLE men were further subdivided based on intensity of lifelong exercise and competitive status into performance (LLE-P, n = 14) and fitness (LLE-F, n = 7). On average, LLE exercised 5 day/wk for 7 h/wk over the past 52\u2009\u00b1\u20091 yr. Each subject performed a maximal cycle test to assess V\u0307o<sub>2max</sub> and had a vastus lateralis muscle biopsy to examine capillarization and metabolic enzymes [citrate synthase, \u03b2-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (\u03b2-HAD), and glycogen phosphorylase]. V\u0307o<sub>2max</sub> had a hierarchical pattern (YE &gt; LLE &gt; OH, P &lt; 0.05) for women (44\u2009\u00b1\u20092 &gt; 26\u2009\u00b1\u20092 &gt; 18\u2009\u00b1\u20091 ml\u00b7kg-1\u00b7min-1) and men (53\u2009\u00b1\u20093 &gt; 34\u2009\u00b1\u20091 &gt; 22\u2009\u00b1 1 ml\u00b7kg-1\u00b7min-1) and was greater ( P &lt; 0.05) in LLE-P (38\u2009\u00b1\u20091 ml\u00b7kg-1\u00b7min-1) than LLE-F (27 \u00b1\u20092 ml\u00b7kg-1\u00b7min-1). LLE men regardless of intensity and women had similar capillarization and aerobic enzyme activity (citrate synthase and \u03b2-HAD) as YE, which were 20%-90% greater ( P &lt; 0.05) than OH. In summary, these data show a substantial V\u0307o<sub>2max</sub> benefit with LLE that tracked similarly between the sexes, with further enhancement in performance-trained men. For skeletal muscle, 50+ years of aerobic exercise fully preserved capillarization and aerobic enzymes, regardless of intensity. These data suggest that skeletal muscle metabolic fitness may be easier to maintain with lifelong aerobic exercise than more central aspects of the cardiovascular system. NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY Lifelong exercise (LLE) is a relatively new and evolving area of study with information especially limited in women and individuals with varying exercise intensity habits. These data show a substantial maximal oxygen consumption benefit with LLE that tracked similarly between the sexes. Our findings contribute to the very limited skeletal muscle biopsy data from LLE women (&gt;70 yr), and similar to men, revealed a preserved metabolic phenotype comparable to young exercisers."

Incident glaucoma was defined based on physician diagnosis. Participants were 9519 men and women between the ages of 40 and 81 yr old (mean age 50 yr) who were enrolled in the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study. Hazard ratios (HR) were estimated using Cox proportional hazard regression after adjusting for age, sex, race, examination year, smoking status, heavy alcohol drinking, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, abnormal ECG, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.\nRESULTS: A total of 128 cases of incident glaucoma were reported during a mean follow-up of 5.7 yr. A significantly lower risk of incident glaucoma (HR = 0.53, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 0.35-0.79) was found in individuals who met the physical activity guidelines of \u2265500 MET\u00b7min\u00b7wk compared with inactive individuals (0 MET\u00b7min\u00b7wk). Compared with low fitness (lower third), individuals with high fitness (upper third) also had a significantly lower risk of incident glaucoma (HR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.38-0.95). A joint analysis of physical activity and fitness showed that meeting physical activity guidelines and being in the high fitness category was associated with the lowest risk for developing glaucoma (HR = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.31-0.79).\nCONCLUSION: These data provide epidemiological evidence that meeting physical activity guidelines or being fit reduces the risk of developing glaucoma."

        "year": 2018,
        "abstract_content": "PURPOSE: Moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) are associated with different adjustments in motor output. Changes in motor unit (MU) peripheral properties may contribute to these adjustments, but this is yet to be elucidated. This study evaluated early changes in MU conduction velocity (MUCV) and MU action potential amplitude after 2 wk of either HIIT or MICT.\nMETHODS: Sixteen men were assigned to either an MICT group or HIIT group (n = 8 each), and participated in six training sessions over 14 d. HIIT: 8 to 12 \u00d7 60-s intervals at 100% peak power output. Moderate-intensity continuous training: 90 to 120 min continuous cycling at ~65% V\u02d9O2peak. Preintervention and postintervention, participants performed maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) and submaximal (10%, 30%, 50%, and 70% of MVC) isometric knee extensions while high-density EMG was recorded from the vastus medialis (VM) and vastus lateralis (VL) muscles. The high-density EMG was decomposed into individual MU by convolutive blind-source separation and tracked preintervention and postintervention.\nRESULTS: Both training interventions induced changes in MUCV, but these changes depended on the type of training (P < 0.001). The HIIT group showed higher values of MUCV after training at all torque levels (P < 0.05), MICT only displayed changes in MUCV at low torque levels (10%-30% MVC, P < 0.002). There were no changes in MU action potential amplitude for either group (P = 0.2).\nCONCLUSIONS: Two weeks of HIIT or MICT elicit differential changes in MUCV, likely due to the contrasting load and volume used in such training regimes. This new knowledge on the neuromuscular adaptations to training has implications for exercise prescription."

Design VO<sub>2max</sub> was assessed by open-circuit spirometry during a graded maximal exercise test using cycle ergometry. Multivariable linear regression analysis was applied to identify the most relevant variables and construct the best prediction model for VO<sub>2max</sub> using a random sample of 70% from each of the following age categories: &lt;40, 40-50, 50-70 and &gt;70 years; the remaining 30% was used for validation. Work rate (Watts*6.12/kg of body weight) and gender were considered in the final regression model as predictors of measured VO<sub>2max</sub> and the resulting equation was compared to the traditional American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) equation. Methods Participants were part of the Fitness Registry and the Importance of Exercise National Database (FRIEND), a multi-institutional initiative with the primary objective of establishing normative VO<sub>2max</sub> values across the adult lifespan. The final cohort consisted of 5100 (3378 men; mean age 35.9\u2009\u00b1\u200912.1 years and 1722 women; mean age 47.5\u2009\u00b1\u200914.0 years).

This predictive value was independent of gender, race, cardiac risk factors and cardiac, antihypertensive, metabolic and/or lipid-lowering medication. Conclusion The FRIEND-ergometry equation is considerably more precise than the traditional ACSM equation with an overall error over 30 times lower than that associated with the ACSM equation."

Muscle EI indicates muscle strength and risk of physical dysfunction; however, this observation was determined following examinations of only selected muscle.

The EIs were calculated from rectus femoris (RF), biceps femoris (BF) triceps brachii (TB) and multifidus (MF) using B-mode transverse ultrasound images. Seven functional tests (isometric knee-extension peak torque, functional reach, sit-to-stand, 5-m normal/maximal speed walking, handgrip strength and timed up-and-go) and blood lipid components including adipocytokines were measured in all participants.\nRESULTS: A statistically significant correlation between EI of the RF, TB and BF was observed (r\u2009=\u20090.46-0.50, P\u2009&lt;\u20090.05), but not between EI of the MF and that of other muscles.

However, high costs, required medical supervision, and safety concerns make maximal exercise testing impractical for evaluating mobility-impaired adults. Thus, several submaximal walking protocols have been developed and currently used to estimate peak oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>peak) in CHF patients. However, these tests have to be performed at close to maximum exercise intensity. The aim of this study was to examine the validity of a 500-m treadmill-walking test carried out at moderate intensity for estimating VO<sub>2</sub>peak in community-dwelling adult and elderly patients with CHF and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF).\nMETHODS: Forty-three clinically stable men with HFrEF (age 67.7\u2009\u00b1\u20099.2\u00a0years, and left ventricular ejection fraction, LVEF 38%\u2009\u00b1\u20096%) underwent exercise testing during an outpatient cardiac rehabilitation/secondary prevention program. Each patients completed a CPX, and a moderate and self-paced (11-13/20 on the Borg scale) 500-m treadmill-walking test. Age, weight, height, walk time, and heart rate during the 500-m test were entered into prediction equations previously validated for VO<sub>2</sub>peak estimation from a 1000-m walking test in patients with cardiovascular disease and preserved LVEF.\nRESULTS: Directly measured and estimated VO<sub>2</sub>peak values were not different (21.6\u2009\u00b1\u20094.9 vs 21.7\u2009\u00b1\u20094.6\u00a0mL/kg/min). The comparison between measured and estimated VO<sub>2</sub>peak values yielded a correlation of R\u00a0=\u20090.97 (SEE\u2009=\u20090.7\u00a0mL/kg/min, P\u00a0&lt;\u20090.0001). The slope and the intercept coincided with the line of identity (Passing and Bablock analysis, P\u00a0=\u20090.50). Residuals were normally distributed, and the examination of the Bland-Altman analysis do not show systematic or proportional error.\nCONCLUSIONS: A moderate and self-regulated 500-m treadmill-walking test is a valid tool for VO<sub>2</sub>peak estimation in patients with HFrEF. These findings may have practical implications in the context of transitioning from clinically based programs to fitness facilities or self-guided exercise programs in adults and elderly men with HFrEF."

Therefore, we evaluated the hypothesis that a low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet impairs anaerobic exercise performance, as compared to a high-carbohydrate diet.\nMETHODS: Sixteen men and women (BMI, 23\u00b11 kg/m2, age 23\u00b11 years) participated in a randomized-sequence, counterbalanced crossover study in which they underwent exercise testing after 4 days of either a low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet (LC; <50 g/day and <10% of energy from carbohydrates) or a high-carbohydrate diet (HC; 6-10 g/kg/day carbohydrate). Dietary compliance was assessed with nutrient analysis of diet records, and with measures of urine pH and ketones. Anaerobic exercise performance was evaluated with the Wingate anaerobic cycling test and the yo-yo intermittent recovery test.\nRESULTS: The diets were matched for total energy (LC: 2333\u00b1158 kcal/d; HC: 2280\u00b1160 kcal/d; P=0.65) but differed in carbohydrate content (9\u00b11% vs. 63\u00b12% of energy intake; P<0.001). LC resulted in lower urine pH (5.9\u00b10.1 vs. 6.3\u00b10.2, P=0.004) and the appearance of urine ketones in every participant. LC resulted in 7% lower peak power (801\u00b158 watts vs. 857\u00b161 watts, P=0.008) and 6% lower mean power (564\u00b150 watts vs. 598\u00b151 watts, P=0.01) during the Wingate Test. Total distance ran in the yo-yo intermittent recovery test was 15% less after LC diet (887\u00b1139 vs. 1045\u00b1145 meters, P=0.02).\nCONCLUSIONS: Short-term low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diets reduce exercise performance in activities that are heavily dependent on anaerobic energy systems.

Associations of demographic, behavioural, physiological and psychological factors with vertical acceleration peaks \u22651.5 g (i.e. high-impact PA) from 7-day hip-worn accelerometer recordings were examined using linear regression.\nRESULTS: A total of 1187 participants (mean age = 72.7 years, 66.6% females) were included. Age, sex, education, active transport, self-reported higher impact PA, walking speed and self-rated health were independently associated with high-impact PA whereas BMI and sleep quality showed borderline independent associations. For example, differences in log-high-impact counts were 0.50 (P < 0.001) for men versus women and -0.56 (P < 0.001) for worst versus best self-rated health. Our final model explained 23% of between-participant variance in high impacts. Other correlates were not associated with high-impact activity after adjustment.\nCONCLUSIONS: Besides age and sex, several factors were associated with higher impact PA in later life. Our findings help identify characteristics of older people that might benefit from interventions designed to promote osteogenic PA."

College-aged RT men (n = 11) completed 4 V[Combining Dot Above]O2max tests using treadmill every 5 days during the 15-day trial. Blood was drawn intravenously pre-exercise across each experimental trial for insulin, cortisol, and glucose. Pulmonary data were collected and substrate oxidation (OXI) was calculated during exercise. Body mass decreased (p < 0.04) with no further changes in anthropometric measures. Time to exhaustion was not affected across each day. Insulin dropped below baseline values (p < 0.0005). Cortisol increased from baseline to day 5 (p < 0.004) but returned back to near baseline at day 10, whereas glucose remained within normal range throughout the duration of the study. Carbohydrate (CHO) OXI dropped (p < 0.001) from baseline to day 5, and fat OXI increased from baseline to day 5 (p < 0.0001). Heart rate decreased from baseline to day 5 (p < 0.001) and again from day 10 to 15 (p < 0.02). Oxygen uptake (V[Combining Dot Above]O2) decreased from day 5 to 10 (p < 0.0001). A nonketo LCHF diet appears to favor RT men by altering metabolic markers without decrements in aerobic performance and be a potential diet intervention used by coaches. However, the reported cardiorespiratory responses should be interpreted reasonably because of the possibility the subjects running economy improved over experimental trials."

Alcohol consumption contributes substantially to the burden of disease, but its association with cardiorespiratory fitness is not well described. We examined associations between average alcohol consumption, heavy episodic drinking and cardiorespiratory fitness. Design The design of this study was as a cross-sectional population-based random sample. Methods We analysed data from five independent population-based studies (Study of Health in Pomerania (2008-2012); German Health Interview and Examination Survey (2008-2011); US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2000; NHANES 2001-2002; NHANES 2003-2004) including 7358 men and women aged 20-85 years, free of lung disease or asthma. Cardiorespiratory fitness, quantified by peak oxygen uptake, was assessed using exercise testing. Information regarding average alcohol consumption (ethanol in grams per day (g/d)) and heavy episodic drinking (5+ or 6+ drinks/occasion) was obtained from self-reports. Fractional polynomial regression models were used to determine the best-fitting dose-response relationship. Results Average alcohol consumption displayed an inverted U-type relation with peak oxygen uptake ( p-value<0.0001), after adjustment for age, sex, education, smoking and physical activity. Compared to individuals consuming 10\u2009g/d (moderate consumption), current abstainers and individuals consuming 50 and 60\u2009g/d had significantly lower peak oxygen uptake values (ml/kg/min) (\u03b2 coefficients\u2009=\u2009-1.90, \u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.06, \u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.31, respectively). Heavy episodic drinking was not associated with peak oxygen uptake. Conclusions Across multiple adult population-based samples, moderate drinkers displayed better fitness than current abstainers and individuals with higher average alcohol consumption."

Participants performed 30 repetitions of eccentric exercise with the non-dominant arm. DOMS, upper arm circumference (CIR), elbow range of motion (ROM), serum creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and aldolase, BCAA, and \u03b2-hydroxy-\u03b2-methylbutyrate (3HMB) were measured immediately before and after the exercise and on the following 4 days.\nRESULTS: Serum BCAA and 3HMB concentrations increased significantly in the PRE group immediately after the exercise, recovering to baseline over the following days. In the days following the exercise day, DOMS, CIR, and ROM were significantly improved in the PRE group compared to the control group, with weaker effects in the POST group. Serum activities of CK, LDH, and aldolase in the days following the exercise day were significantly suppressed in the PRE group compared to control group.\nCONCLUSIONS: The present study confirmed that repeated BCAA supplementation before exercise had a more beneficial effect in attenuating DOMS and EIMD induced by eccentric exercise than repeated supplementation after exercise."

None of the current treatment regimens for Alzheimer's disease are effective in arresting progression. Lifestyle choices may prevent cognitive decline. This study aims to clarify which factors best predict cognitive function.\nMETHODS: This was a prospective cross-sectional analysis of 799 men and women undergoing health and cognitive testing every 1 to 3\u00a0years at an outpatient center. This study utilizes data collected from the first patient visit. Participant ages were 18 to 88 (mean = 50.7) years and the sample was 26.6% female and 73.4% male.\nOUTCOME MEASURES: Measurements were made of body composition, fasting laboratory and anthropometric measures, strength and aerobic fitness, nutrient and dietary intake, and carotid intimal media thickness (IMT). Each participant was tested with a computerized neurocognitive test battery. Cognitive outcomes were assessed in bivariate analyses using t-tests and correlation coefficients and in multivariable analysis (controlling for age) using multiple linear regression.\nRESULTS: The initial bivariate analyses showed better Neurocognitive Index (NCI) scores with lower age, greater fitness scores (push-up strength, VO<sub>2</sub>max, and exercise duration during treadmill testing), and lower fasting glucose levels. Better cognitive flexibility scores were also noted with younger age, lower systolic blood pressure, lower body fat, lower carotid IMT scores, greater fitness, and higher alcohol intake. After controlling for age, factors that remained associated with better NCI scores include no tobacco use, lower fasting glucose levels, and better fitness (aerobic and strength). Higher cognitive flexibility scores remained associated with greater aerobic and strength fitness, lower body fat, and higher intake of alcohol.\nCONCLUSIONS: Modifiable biomarkers that impact cognitive performance favorably include greater aerobic fitness and strength, lower blood sugar levels, greater alcohol intake, lower body fat, and avoidance of tobacco. Further studies are warranted to study whether modifying these lifestyle factors improves cognitive function and slows cognitive decline."

        "abstract_content": "Slow walking speed is strongly associated with adverse health outcomes, including cognitive impairment, in the older population. Moreover, adequate walking speed is crucial to maintain older pedestrians' mobility and safety in urban areas. This study aimed to identify the proportion of Swiss older adults that didn't reach 1.2 m/s, which reflects the requirements to cross streets within the green-yellow phase of pedestrian lights, when walking fast under cognitive challenge. A convenience sample, including 120 older women (65%) and men, was recruited from the community (88%) and from senior residences and divided into groups of 70-79 years (n = 59, 74.8 \u00b1 0.4 y; mean \u00b1 SD) and \u226580 years (n = 61, 85.5 \u00b1 0.5 y). Steady state walking speed was assessed under single- and dual-task conditions at preferred and fast walking speed. Additionally, functional lower extremity strength (5-chair-rises test), subjective health rating, and retrospective estimates of fall frequency were recorded. Results showed that 35.6% of the younger and 73.8% of the older participants were not able to walk faster than 1.2 m/s under the fast dual-task walking condition. Fast dual-task walking speed was higher compared to the preferred speed single- and dual-task conditions (all p < .05, r = .31 to .48). Average preferred single-task walking speed was 1.19 \u00b1 0.24 m/s (70-79 y) and 0.94 \u00b1 0.27 m/s (\u226580 y), respectively, and correlated with performance in the 5-chair-rises test (rs = -.49, p < .001), subjective health (\u03c4 = .27, p < .001), and fall frequency (\u03c4 = -.23, p = .002). We conclude that the fitness status of many older people is inadequate to safely cross streets at pedestrian lights and maintain mobility in the community's daily life in urban areas. Consequently, training measures to improve the older population's cognitive and physical fitness should be promoted to enhance walking speed and safety of older pedestrians."

        "year": 2017,
        "abstract_content": "BACKGROUND: Various positive effects of exercise on older women have been identified in many studies. Despite the importance of preserving the health of brain as well as body, few studies have investigated the effects of strength exercise on the brain health of older women to date. This study aimed to identify the effects of 24weeks of the Growing Stronger program on hippocampus volume and functional fitness of older women.\nMETHODS: Twenty one older women aged 67 to 81 participated in this study. Growing Stronger, which is a strength exercise program that is safe and effective for women and men of all ages, was conducted. The 11 strength exercise group (n=11) participated for 50-80min a day three times per week for a total of 24weeks. The control group maintained their lifestyles without any special intervention. Participants were given a pre-test (before applying for the program) and post-test (after 24weeks) to identify effects of the program. The data were analyzed with repeated measures ANOVA.\nRESULTS: Hippocampus volume was significantly increased in the strength exercise group, but decreased in the control group. Moreover, there was an interaction effect (p<0.001) between time and group. Strength exercise has improved upper and lower body strength, lower body flexibility, agility, and dynamic balance. Upper body flexibility significantly decreased in the strength exercise group, but there was no interaction between the strength exercise group and the control group.\nCONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that strength exercise has beneficial effects on hippocampus volume and functional fitness. Therefore, strength exercise can be an effective exercise for older women."

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine participation and performance trends in age groups swimmers competing in FINA World Masters Championships (1986-2014) in individual 200-m and 400-m medley.\nMETHODS: We included all swimmers (6424 women, 7588 men) for each distance and age groups (25-29 to 95-99 years) in the analysis to avoid a selection bias by limiting to a fixed sample (e.g. the ten fastest). Changes in participation and changes in sex difference across editions were analyzed using linear regression models. Changes in performance across editions were analyzed using a mixed-effects regression model with finisher as random variable to consider finishers who completed several races. Sex, distance and calendar year were included as fixed variables. We also considered interaction effects between sex and distance. The men-to-women ratio was compared using a paired t-test.\nRESULTS: In 200 m, the participation of women increased from 35-39 to 75-79 years and of men from 35-39 to 85-89 years (P<0.05). In 400 m, the participation of women increased from 50-54 to 75-79 years and of men from 60-64 to 85-89 years (P<0.05). From 25-29 to 90-94 years, women and men improved performance in both editions (P<0.05). Men were faster than women from 25-29 to 80-84 years (P<0.05), but not in 85-90 and 90-94 years. Sex and distance showed a significant interaction from 25-29 to 85-89 years (P<0.05), but not in 90-94 years. Women reduced the gap to men in 40-44 and 45-49 years in 200 m, and 40-44 years in 400 m (P<0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: In summary, the participation increased in older age groups (>35 years), women and men from 25-29 to 90-94 years improved, and men were faster than women from 25-29 to 80-84 years, but not from 85-89 to 90-94 years. These data suggest that master swimmers will continue to increase participation and improve performance in individual medley. The findings of the present study might help coaches and fitness trainers of medley swimmers to tailor their training programs considering the age of their swimmers."

        "abstract_content": "It has been reported that eccentric training of knee extensors is effective for improving blood insulin sensitivity and lipid profiles to a greater extent than concentric training in young women. However, it is not known whether this is also the case for elderly individuals. Thus, the present study tested the hypothesis that eccentric training of the knee extensors would improve physical function and health parameters (e.g., blood lipid profiles) of older adults better than concentric training. Healthy elderly men (60-76 years) were assigned to either eccentric training or concentric training group (n = 13/group), and performed 30-60 eccentric or concentric contractions of knee extensors once a week. The intensity was progressively increased over 12 weeks from 10 to 100% of maximal concentric strength for eccentric training and from 50 to 100% for concentric training. Outcome measures were taken before and 4 days after the training period. The results showed that no sings of muscle damage were observed after any sessions. Functional physical fitness (e.g., 30-s chair stand) and maximal concentric contraction strength of the knee extensors increased greater (P \u2264 0.05) after eccentric training than concentric training. Homeostasis model assessment, oral glucose tolerance test and whole blood glycosylated hemoglobin showed improvement of insulin sensitivity only after eccentric training (P \u2264 0.05). Greater (P \u2264 0.05) decreases in fasting triacylglycerols, total, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterols were evident after eccentric training than concentric training, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterols increased only after eccentric training. These results support the hypothesis and suggest that it is better to focus on eccentric contractions in exercise medicine."

Data from the 1999-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were used to identify 16,146 participants, ages 20-85. Data from participants in these cycles were linked to death certificate data from the National Death Index. Person-months of follow-up were calculated from the date of the interview until date of death or censoring on December 31, 2011, whichever came first.\nRESULTS: In a Cox proportional hazard model, for every 1 FFI unit increase, participants had a 14% reduced hazard of Alzheimer-specific death (HR=0.86; 95% CI: 0.83-0.90; P<0.001). When including diabetes and hypertension (via physician-diagnosis) as covariates, results were unchanged (HR=0.87; 95% CI: 0.82-0.91; P<0.001). Results were also unchanged when restricting the sample to those 50+years (HR=0.92; 95% CI: 0.88-0.97; P=0.005) or stratifying by men (HR=0.85; 95% CI: 0.81-0.91; P<0.001) or women (HR=0.86; 95% CI: 0.79-0.94; P=0.002).\nCONCLUSION: In this national sample of individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease, increased FFI was associated with reduced risk of Alzheimer's-specific death. Thus, a more favorable fitness-to-fatness ratio is associated with reduced risk of Alzheimer's-specific mortality, underscoring the importance of fitness promoting and fatness reducing strategies."

The physical activity recall assessment for people with SCI was used to assess LTPA among 84 men and 35 women (mean age 63.5 years, mean time since injury 24 years, injury levels C1-L5, American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale A-D). Associations were analyzed statistically using hierarchical multivariable regression.\nRESULTS: Twenty-nine percent reported no LTPA, whereas 53% performed moderate-to-heavy intensity LTPA. The mean minutes per day of total LTPA was 34.7 (\u00b141.5, median 15, range 0-171.7) and of moderate-to-heavy LTPA 22.5 (\u00b135.1, median 5.0, range 0-140.0). The most frequently performed activities were walking and wheeling. Sociodemographics, injury characteristics and SHCs (bowel-related and bladder-related problems, spasticity and pain) explained 10.6% and 13.4%, respectively, of the variance in total and moderate-to-heavy LTPA. Age and wheelchair use were significantly, negatively associated with total LTPA. Women, wheelchair users and employed participants performed significantly less moderate-to-heavy LTPA than men, those using walking devices/no mobility device and unemployed participants.\nCONCLUSION: Many older adults with long-term SCI do not reach the amount or intensity of LTPA needed to achieve fitness benefits. Research is needed on how to increase LTPA and to identify modifiable factors that could enhance their participation."

We examined the effect of a 6-month program of aerobic and resistance exercise aimed at improving body composition and cardiorespiratory health in this population.\nMETHODS: Ninety-seven men (43-90 yr) with localized prostate cancer receiving ADT were randomized to either exercise (EX, n = 50) or usual care (CON, n = 47). Supervised exercise was undertaken twice weekly at moderate to high intensity. Measures of cardiorespiratory capacity (V\u02d9O2max), resting metabolic rate, central blood pressure, hemodynamic variables, blood markers, and body composition were assessed.\nRESULTS: There was a significant group-time interaction present for V\u02d9O2max (P = 0.033) with a treatment effect for EX of 0.11 L\u00b7min (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.04-0.19) (relative to body mass = 1.3 mL\u00b7kg\u00b7min, 95% CI = 0.3-2.3) and fat oxidation (P = 0.037) of 12.0 mg\u00b7min (95% CI = 2.3-21.7). Similarly, there was a significant improvement in glucose (P < 0.001) for EX of -0.5 mmol\u00b7L (95% CI = -0.8 to -0.3), with no change in prostate-specific antigen or testosterone as a result of exercise. Body composition was enhanced for EX with adjusted mean differences in lean mass (P = 0.015) of 0.8 kg (95% CI = 0.3-1.3), total fat mass (P = 0.020) of -1.1 kg (95% CI = -1.8 to -0.5), and trunk fat mass (P < 0.001) of -1.0 kg (95% CI = -1.4 to -0.6).\nCONCLUSION: A 6-month combined aerobic and resistance exercise program has a significant favorable effect on cardiorespiratory capacity, resting fat oxidation, glucose, and body composition despite the adverse effects of hormone suppression. Combined aerobic and resistance training should be considered a key adjuvant component in men undergoing ADT for the treatment of prostate cancer."

The MEC was quantified in metabolic equivalents of task (METs) calculated from peak workload on a treadmill and adjusted to the equivalent for a 50-year-old man. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to assess risk of all-cause mortality associated with change in MEC based on (1) change from age-/sex-adjusted low fitness (<8 METs) to intermediate or high fitness and (2) an absolute change in METs.\nRESULTS: Relative to patients with low fitness at both tests, increasing from low to intermediate or high fitness was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]\u00a0= 0.63 [95% CI, 0.45-0.87] in men and 0.56 [95% CI, 0.34-0.91] in women).

Herein, we explore whether gains in cardiovascular fitness predict successful weight loss in men participating in a weight loss trial (NCT01886677).\nMETHODS: Forty men were randomized to receive twice-weekly in-person and telephone-based guidance on calorie-restricted diets and aerobic exercise to promote ~0.91 kg/week weight loss, or wait-list control. Thirty-two men completed submaximal VO<sub>2</sub> Treadmill Tests (TT), anthropometric measures and two 24-hour dietary recalls at baseline and follow-up. For this secondary analysis, study arms were combined and associations between baseline and longitudinal changes in physiological effort (PE, measured by heart rate during TT), predicted VO<sub>2max</sub>, caloric intake and weight loss were analyzed.\nRESULTS: Men lost 3.4 kg in 50 \u00b1 23 days on the study. Multivariate linear regression indicated weight change was associated with change in PE at stage 2TT (Partial R = 0.635, p < 0.001), days on study (Partial R = -0.589, p = 0.002) and change in caloric intake (Partial R = 0.457, p = 0.019).\nCONCLUSIONS: Untrained men experiencing elevated heart rates during stage 2TT at baseline were able to achieve greater weight loss over the study period; this association was strengthened by a decrease in PE at the same level from baseline to follow-up concomitant with reduced caloric intake. Therefore, for these middle-aged and older men with lower aerobic fitness, exercise appears to be a key factor in achieving higher degrees of weight loss."

        "abstract_content": "PURPOSE: It has been reported that ~50% of endurance-trained men demonstrate exercise-induced arterial hypoxemia (EIAH) during heavy exercise. However, this often-cited prevalence rate comes from a single study using a cohort of 25 highly trained men who completed maximal cycle ergometry. As arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2) during maximal exercise is reported to be significantly lower during treadmill versus cycle ergometry in the same subjects, we hypothesized that the prevalence of EIAH would be greater than previously reported (and commonly referenced) in a larger cohort of highly endurance-trained men during maximal treadmill running.\nMETHODS: Data from 124 highly trained male distance runners (V\u02d9O2max range = 60.3-84.7 mL\u00b7kg\u00b7min) were retrospectively examined from previously published studies completed in the Indiana University Human Performance Laboratory. Subjects completed a constant speed, progressive-grade treadmill exercise test to volitional exhaustion, and arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation (SaO2ear) in all subjects was estimated using the same oximeter (Hewlett Packard 47201A).\nRESULTS: Using similar inclusion criteria as previously published for highly trained (V\u02d9O2max > 68 mL\u00b7kg\u00b7min) and for EIAH (SaO2ear \u2264 91%), 55 of 79 subjects (70%) exhibited exercise-induced arterial desaturation. Across all 124 subjects, 104 (84%) demonstrated at least moderate EIAH (SaO2ear \u2264 93%) during maximal treadmill exercise. SaO2ear was significantly yet weakly correlated with V\u02d9E/V\u02d9O2 (P < 0.01, r = 0.28) and V\u02d9E/V\u02d9CO2 (P < 0.001, r = 0.33) but not with V\u02d9O2max.\nCONCLUSION: These results indicate that the prevalence of EIAH in highly trained men during maximal treadmill exercise at sea level is greater compared with previously suggested data, with exercise mode perhaps playing a factor in the number of athletes who experience EIAH."

J Strength Cond Res 31(1): 207-216, 2017-The purpose of this investigation was to determine the effects of physical training (PT) and fitness on risks for running-related injuries (RRIs) in physically active young men. Personal characteristics, PT, Army Physical Fitness Test scores, and injury data were obtained by survey. Army Physical Fitness Test variables (push-ups, sit-ups, and 2-mile run) were converted into quartiles (Q), where Q1 = lowest performance and Q4 = highest performance. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated using multivariate logistic regression. Over 4,000 (n = 4,236) soldiers were surveyed. Running injury incidence was 14%. A greater risk of an RRI was associated with older age (OR31+/<22 years = 1.62, 95% CI, 1.21-2.18), higher BMI ((Equation is included in full-text article.)), and total distance ran per week during unit PT (OR16.1+/1-5 miles = 1.66, 95% CI, 1.15-2.41). A lower risk of an RRI was associated with total distance run per week during personal PT (OR5.1-10/1-5 miles = 0.70, 95% CI, 0.53-0.91, OR10.1-16 +/1-5 miles = 0.58, 95% CI, 0.35-0.97, OR16.1+/1-5 miles = 0.54, 95% CI, 0.30-0.98), higher aerobic endurance as measured by 2-mile run performance (ORQ4/Q1 = 0.50, 95% CI, 0.35-0.72), and unit resistance training \u22653 times a week (OR\u22653 times per week/none = 0.46, 95% CI, 0.29-0.73). Greater personal PT running mileage decreased injuries in this population suggesting that the increased protective effect of higher aerobic fitness outweighed the injurious effect of running more miles during personal PT. Countermeasures to prevent RRIs could entail enhancing aerobic endurance, providing opportunities for personal aerobic training, monitoring for excessive unit PT running mileage and encouraging unit resistance training \u22653 times per week."

        "abstract_content": "BACKGROUND: Chronotropic index is a standardized measure of heart rate (HR) increment during exercise that reflects the combined effects of age, resting HR, and physical fitness. Low chronotropic index has been reported to predict disease and death. We tested whether temporal change in chronotropic index over 7\u00a0years influenced risk of cardiovascular death through up to 28\u00a0years.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Chronotropic index was calculated ([achieved maximal HR-resting HR]/[age-predicted maximal HR-resting HR]) after a symptom-limited bicycle ECG exercise test in 1420 healthy men at 2 examinations 7\u00a0years apart, in 1972 and 1979. Events of cardiovascular death were registered by manual scrutiny of all participants' hospital charts and the Norwegian Cause of Death Registry. The participants were divided into quartiles of temporal change in chronotropic index, with quartile one having the most negative value. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate risks and adjusted for classical cardiovascular risk factors. Incidence of cardiovascular death was 310 (22%) during median of 21\u00a0years of follow-up. After multivariable adjustment, and comparison with quartile four (mean +0.11), quartiles one (-0.16), two (-0.04), and three (+0.02) were associated with hazard ratios 1.50 (95% CI 1.10-2.05), 1.10 (0.79-1.53), and 1.04 (0.74-1.45) for cardiovascular death. Results remained robust also after exclusion of 31 participants with exercise ECG-induced signs of coronary ischemia.\nCONCLUSIONS: Temporal reduction in chronotropic index was associated with increased long-term risk of cardiovascular death and might be a clinically important predictor when assessing risk in healthy individuals over a longer time."

        "year": 2018,
        "abstract_content": "BACKGROUND: We examined the effect of early-onset of muscle damage and low muscle glycogen on cardiorespiratory and metabolic responses to low-intensity exercise.\nMETHODS: Twelve men cycled for 10 min at 50% maximal oxygen uptake before, and 12 h after a morning downhill run (five, 8 min bouts at -12% gradient, with 2 min rests) under normal (NORM) and lowered glycogen (LOW) conditions, following a cross-over design with conditions separated by six weeks. Cardiorespiratory responses were recorded, with oxidation measures derived from stoichiometry equations.\nRESULTS: Muscle damage symptoms post-downhill (0 h) were similar between conditions. Carbon dioxide ventilatory equivalent increased 12 h post-downhill for LOW (P<0.05), but not NORM (P=0.7). A trend towards decreased respiratory exchange ratio (RER) was shown 12 h post-downhill for LOW (1.00\u00b10.07 to 0.89\u00b10.12, P=0.06), but not NORM (0.94\u00b10.11 to 0.94\u00b10.08; P=0.6). Twelve hours after LOW downhill running fat oxidation increased (0.21\u00b10.18 g\u00b7min-1 to 0.36\u00b10.27 g\u00b7min-1; P<0.05) and carbohydrate oxidation decreased (2.68\u00b10.52 g\u00b7min-1 to 1.98\u00b10.75 g\u00b7min-1; P<0.05); NORM oxidation rates were unchanged (fat: 0.26\u00b10.18 g\u00b7min-1 to 0.33\u00b10.18 g\u00b7min-1; P=0.5; carbohydrate: 2.51\u00b10.49 g\u00b7min-1 to 2.29\u00b10.47 g\u00b7min-1; P=0.3).\nCONCLUSIONS: Cycling at low-intensity 12 h post-downhill running with lowered muscle glycogen increased fat oxidation, decreased carbohydrate oxidation and elevated carbon dioxide ventilation. Damaging exercise with reduced glycogen availability increases fat utilization during subsequent low-intensity exercise as little as 12 h later."

However, information about stability of fitness components and diet quality indices is limited. This study aimed to evaluate stability of those parameters.\nMETHODS: This study includes 652 adults (men=57.56 (10.28) years; women=55.90 (8.34) years at follow-up) who participated in 2002-2004 and returned for follow-up at the Policy Research Centre Leuven in 2012-2014. Minutes sport per day and Physical activity level (PAL) were calculated from the Flemish Physical Activity Computerized Questionnaire. Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), morphological fitness (MORF; body mass index and waist circumference) and metabolic fitness (METF) (blood cholesterol and triglycerides) were used as fitness components. Diet quality indices (Healthy Eating Index-2010 (HEI), Diet Quality Index (DQI), Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS)) were calculated from a diet record. Tracking coefficients were calculated using Pearson/Spearman correlation coefficients (r<sub>Pearson</sub>) and intra-class correlation coefficients (r<sub>ICC</sub>).\nRESULTS: In both men (r<sub>Pearson&amp;ICC</sub>=0.51) and women (r<sub>Pearson</sub>=0.62 and r<sub>ICC</sub>=0.60) PAL showed good stability, while minutes sport remained stable in women (r<sub>Pearson&amp;ICC</sub>=0.57) but less in men (r<sub>Pearson&amp;ICC</sub>=0.45). Most fitness components remained stable (r\u2a7e0.50) except some METF components in women. In general the diet quality indices and their components were unstable (r&lt;0.50).\nCONCLUSIONS: PAL and the majority of the fitness components remained stable, while diet quality was unstable over 10 years. For unstable parameters such as diet quality measurements are needed at both time points in prospective research."

However, many graduates fail to maintain exercise post-program. ECO-PCR investigates the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a social ecologically-based intervention to increase long-term exercise maintenance following the completion of CR.\nMETHODS/DESIGN: A three-site, 2-group, parallel randomized controlled trial is underway. 412 male and 192 female (N=604) supervised CR participants are being recruited just before CR graduation. Participants are randomized (1:1 concealed allocation) to intervention or usual care. A 50-week exercise facilitator intervention has been designed to assist CR graduates in the transition from structured, supervised exercise to self-managed home- or community-based (e.g., Heart Wise Exercise programs) exercise. The intervention consists of 8 telephone contacts over the 50week period: 3 individual and 5 group. Assessments occur at CR graduation, and 26, 52 and 78weeks post-randomization. The primary outcome is change in minutes of accelerometer-measured moderate to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) from CR graduation to 52weeks post-randomization. Secondary measures include exercise capacity, quality of life, and cardiovascular risk factors. Analyses will be undertaken based on intention-to-treat. For the primary outcome, an analysis of variance will be computed to test the change in minutes of MVPA in each group between CR graduation and 52week follow-up (2 [arm]\u00d72 [time]). Secondary objectives will be assessed using mixed-model repeated measures analyses to compare differences between groups over time. Mean costs and quality-adjusted life years for each arm will be estimated."

We determined the prognostic significance of exercise test findings for cardiovascular (CVD) and all-cause mortality in men and women.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: 3033 subjects underwent a symptom-limited bicycle exercise test. Exercise capacity was defined as the mean of last four minutes of exercise workload.\nRESULTS: During an average follow-up of 19 years, 186 (11.6%) CVD and 370 (20.6%) all-cause deaths in men and 57 (5.0%) CVD and 155 (12.5%) all-cause deaths in women occurred. Among exercise test variables (workload, ECG, BP, HR), exercise capacity was the strongest predictor of mortality. Low exercise capacity (1st quartile) was associated with a hazard ratio of 4.2 (95% CI: 1.7, 10.8) for CVD and 4.0 (95% CI: 2.5, 6.4) for all-cause mortality compared with high exercise capacity (4th quartile) among men and in women with a 5.4-fold (95% CI: 1.2, 24.0) risk for CVD and 2.3-fold (95% CI: 1.2, 4.3) risk for all-cause mortality, respectively. The relationship between other exercise test variables and mortality was much weaker.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among exercise test variables exercise capacity was the strongest predictor of CVD and all-cause mortality in both genders, and especially CVD deaths in women. Key Messages Exercise capacity was the most powerful predictor of CVD and all-cause mortality in both men and women. Low exercise capacity is a strong predictor of CVD death, especially among women."

We investigated these factors in Chinese adults over a 14-year period (2000-14) using data from randomised national surveys.\nMETHODS: We did four national surveys in 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2014 among Chinese adults aged 20-59 years. We used BMI to assess underweight (<18\u00b75 kg/m(2)), overweight (\u226523\u00b70 to <27\u00b75 kg/m(2)), and obesity (\u226527\u00b75 kg/m(2)). Central obesity was defined as a waist circumference greater than 90 cm in men and greater than 85 cm in women. We assessed leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) by whether or not participants had completed the recommended minimum 150 min of moderate or 75 min of vigorous exercise per week. Indices for assessment of physical fitness were forced vital capacity, resting heart rate, hand grip strength, sit and reach distance, and time standing on one leg.\nFINDINGS: 151\u2008656 (78%) of 193\u2008440 adults responded to the survey in 2000, 163\u2008386 (84%) in 2005, 154\u2008931 (80%) in 2010, and 146\u2008703 (76%) in 2014. The prevalence of obesity increased from 8\u00b76% in 2000, to 10\u00b73% in 2005, 12\u00b72% in 2010, and 12\u00b79% in 2014 (estimated increase 0\u00b732% per year, 95% CI 0\u00b730-0\u00b733; p<0\u00b70001). The equivalent estimates were 37\u00b74%, 39\u00b72%, 40\u00b77%, and 41\u00b72% for overweight (estimated increase 0\u00b727% per year, 95% CI 0\u00b725-0\u00b730; p<0\u00b70001) and 13\u00b79%, 18\u00b73%, 22\u00b71%, and 24\u00b79% for central obesity (estimated increase 0\u00b778% per year, 0\u00b776-0\u00b780; p<0\u00b70001). The prevalence of overweight, obesity, and central obesity increased with age (all p<0\u00b70001) and was higher in men than in women (all p<0\u00b70001). We noted a simultaneous decrease in the prevalence of underweight (estimated decrease of 0\u00b706% per year, 95% CI 0\u00b704-0\u00b707; p<0\u00b70001). The proportion of adults meeting the minimum LTPA recommendation increased over time (17\u00b72% in 2000, 18\u00b71% in 2005, and 22\u00b78% in 2014), with the estimated prevalence change per year being 0\u00b733% (95% CI 0\u00b724-0\u00b742; p<0\u00b70001) for underweight people, 0\u00b750% (0\u00b747-0\u00b753; p<0\u00b70001) for normal-weight people, 0\u00b737% (0\u00b734-0\u00b740; p<0\u00b70001) for overweight people, and 0\u00b706% (0\u00b700-0\u00b713; p=0\u00b7044) for obese people. We noted deteriorations over time in all measures of physical fitness in normal-weight adults (all p<0\u00b70001), apart from resting heart rate (p=0\u00b769).\nINTERPRETATION: Despite increased participation in LTPA, we noted increases in overweight or obesity and a decrease in physical fitness in Chinese adults.

Maximal treadmill tests were conducted using the Balke protocol and were used to estimate CRF. We stratified patients into low, moderate, and high CRF categories. The FN BMD was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Odds ratios (ORs) for T-scores of\u00a0-2.5 or less (osteoporosis) and\u00a0-1.0 or less (low BMD) were calculated for categorical CRF and were adjusted for weight, age, and days per week of resistance activity.\nRESULTS: The sample prevalence of osteoporosis in the FN was 4.1% and of low BMD was 49.4%. There was a significant inverse association between higher CRF category and osteoporosis measured at the FN (moderate vs low: OR=0.34; 95% CI, 0.16-0.74; high vs low: OR=0.19; 95% CI, 0.09-0.42) and low BMD (moderate vs low: OR=0.64; 95% CI, 0.43-0.96; high vs low: OR=0.43; 95% CI, 0.29-0.65).\nCONCLUSION: In men, CRF is directly associated with BMD. These results suggest that moderate-to-high CRF levels attained through regular physical activity may attenuate age-related decline in BMD. Further studies are needed to determine whether this translates to a lower risk of osteoporotic fracture in more fit men."

This exploratory and descriptive study was undertaken to confirm feasibility of performing the FMS\u2122 in older active adults, assess prevalence of asymmetries and to evaluate the relationship between functional movement ability, age, physical activity levels and body mass index (BMI).\nMETHODS: This is an observational study; 97 men (n\u2009=\u200953) and women (n\u2009=\u200944) between the ages of 52 and 83 participated. BMI was computed and self-reported physical activity levels were obtained. Subjects were grouped by age (5-year intervals), BMI (normal, over-weight, and obese) and sex. Each participant's performance on the FMS\u2122 was digitally recorded for later analysis.\nRESULTS: The youngest age group (50-54 years) scored highest in all seven tests and the oldest age group (75+) scored lowest in most of the tests compared to all other age groups. The subjects in the \"normal weight\" group performed no different than those who were in the \"overweight\" group; both groups performed better than the \"obese\" group. Of the 97 participants 54 had at least one asymmetry. The pairwise correlations between the total FMS\u2122 score and age (r\u2009=\u2009-0.531), BMI (r\u2009=\u2009-0.270), and the measure of activity level (r\u2009=\u20090.287) were significant (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.01 for all).\nCONCLUSION: FMS\u2122 scores decline with increased BMI, increased age, and decreased activity level. The screen identifies range of motion- and strength-related asymmetries. The FMS\u2122 can be used to assess functional limitations and asymmetries. Future research should evaluate if a higher total FMS\u2122 score is related to fewer falls or injuries in the older population."

The battery of tests consisted of two balance items, two flexibility items, five muscular strength and endurance items, two aerobic items, and one functional task. All items were considered valid and reliable tests in a general elderly or intellectually disabled population. The test-retest relative reliability for all repeated tests was assessed with intraclass correlation coefficient performing one-way analysis of variance. The test-retest absolute variability was measured by using the standard error of measurement (SEM) to calculate the minimal detectable change at the 90% confidence interval (MDC90). Reliability data was visualised with a Bland-Altman plot.\nRESULTS: All tests showed excellent intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC's>0.9). All SEM values demonstrated acceptable measurement precision (SEM<SD/2). Values for MDC90 are provided for all 12 tests. The analyses indicated that there was no major systematic bias in the plots. The scatter around the Bland-Altman was distributed randomly.\nCONCLUSION: All twelve functional fitness tests demonstrated adequate feasibility and relative and absolute test-retest reliability in adults with Down syndrome in South Africa. Information of this nature will help to monitor performance alterations over time and success of training interventions."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the Type 2 diabetes mellitus Prevention Using LifeStyle Education (PULSE) Program, a self-administered and gender-tailored lifestyle intervention for men at high risk for developing Type 2 diabetes mellitus.\nDESIGN/SETTING: A 6-month, assessor-blinded, parallel-group RCT was conducted at the University of Newcastle, Australia in 2012-2013.\nPARTICIPANTS: Men (aged 18-65 years, BMI 25-40 kg/m(2), high risk for developing Type 2 diabetes mellitus) were stratified by age (<50 and >50 years) and BMI category (25.0-29.9, 30.0-35.9, and 35.0-40 kg/m(2)) and individually randomized (1:1 ratio) to the intervention (n=53) or waitlist control groups (n=48).\nINTERVENTION: The intervention group received the PULSE Program, which contained print and video resources on weight loss (Self-Help, Exercise and Diet using Internet Technology [SHED-IT] Weight Loss Program), diet modification, and exercise for Type 2 diabetes mellitus prevention. The waitlist control group received no information until 6 months.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Data were collected from September 2012 to September 2013 and analyzed in 2014-2015. Linear mixed models (intention-to-treat) were used to determine group X time interactions (differences between groups in changes over time) at 6 months for the primary outcome (weight), glycated hemoglobin, and several secondary outcomes (significance level, p<0.05).\nRESULTS: Differences between groups in mean changes from baseline to 6 months (group \u00d7 time interaction) favored the intervention over control group for weight loss (-5.50 kg, 95% CI=-7.40 kg, -3.61 kg, p<0.001, Cohen's d=1.15), glycated hemoglobin (-0.2%, 95% CI=-0.3%, -0.1%, p=0.002, d=0.64), and BMI, waist circumference, body fat percentage, aerobic fitness, and lower body muscular fitness (all p<0.05). No group \u00d7 time effects were observed for fasting plasma glucose, upper body muscular fitness, physical activity, or energy intake.\nCONCLUSIONS: The PULSE Program improved several Type 2 diabetes mellitus risk factors in men, including weight and glycated hemoglobin. These findings provide evidence for a self-administered and gender-tailored lifestyle intervention, which has potential for dissemination in community settings."

        "year": 2015,
        "abstract_content": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the separate effects of exercise intensity and amount on interindividual cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) response.\nPARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Participants were 121 (75 females, 62%) sedentary, middle-aged (mean [SD] age, 53.2 [7.5] years), abdominally obese adults who completed at least 90% of 5 weekly exercise sessions prescribed over a 24-week intervention. Participants were randomly assigned to (1) low-amount, low-intensity exercise (LALI) (180 and 300 kcal per session for women and men, respectively, at 50% of CRF [VO 2peak]; n=39), (2) high-amount, low-intensity exercise (HALI) (360 and 600 kcal per session for women and men, respectively, at 50% of CRF; n=51), or high-amount, high-intensity exercise (HAHI) (360 and 600 kcal per session for women and men, respectively, at 75% of CRF; n=31). Cardiorespiratory fitness was measured using a treadmill test at 4, 8, 16, and 24 weeks. The study duration was September 1, 2009, through May 31, 2013.\nRESULTS: Cardiorespiratory fitness increased within all 3 groups at 24 weeks (P<.001). At 24 weeks, 38.5% (15 of 39), 17.6% (9 of 51), and 0% (0 of 31) of the participants within the LALI, HALI, and HAHI groups, respectively, were CRF nonresponders. At a fixed exercise intensity, increasing exercise amount reduced the rate of nonresponse by 50% (P=.02). At a fixed amount of exercise, increasing the exercise intensity eliminated nonresponse (P=.001). Exposure to exercise decreased the number of CRF nonresponders between 4 and 8 weeks for LALI and by 16 weeks for HALI but plateaued thereafter. For HAHI, the number of CRF nonresponders decreased continually over the 24 weeks.\nCONCLUSION: For a fixed amount of exercise, increasing exercise intensity consistent with consensus recommendations eliminated CRF nonresponse. Low-intensity exercise may not be sufficient to improve CRF for a substantial proportion of sedentary obese adults."

Sixty-nine participants were recruited and randomly assigned to one of three groups, of which sixty-four completed the study: a soccer training group (SOC; n = 20, 34\u00b14 (means\u00b1SD) years, 78.1\u00b18.3 kg, 179\u00b14 cm); a running group (RUN; n = 21, 32\u00b14 years, 78.0\u00b15.5 kg, 179\u00b17 cm); or a passive control group (CON; n = 23, 30\u00b13 years, 76.6\u00b112.0 kg, 178\u00b18 cm). The training intervention lasted 12 weeks and consisted of three 60-min sessions per week. All participants were tested for each of the following physical fitness components: maximal aerobic power, minute ventilation, maximal heart rate, squat jump (SJ), countermovement jump with arm swing (CMJ), sit-and-reach flexibility, and body composition. Over the 12 weeks, VO2max relative to body weight increased more (p<0.05) in SOC (24.2%, ES = 1.20) and RUN (21.5%, ES = 1.17) than in CON (-5.0%, ES = -0.24), partly due to large changes in body mass (-5.9, -5.7 and +2.6 kg, p<0.05 for SOC, RUN and CON, respectively). Over the 12 weeks, SJ and CMJ performance increased more (p<0.05) in SOC (14.8 and 12.1%, ES = 1.08 and 0.81) than in RUN (3.3 and 3.0%, ES = 0.23 and 0.19) and CON (0.3 and 0.2%), while flexibility also increased more (p<0.05) in SOC (94%, ES = 0.97) than in RUN and CON (0-2%). In conclusion, untrained men displayed marked improvements in maximal aerobic power after 12 weeks of soccer training and moderate-intensity running, partly due to large decreases in body mass. Additionally soccer training induced pronounced positive effects on jump performance and flexibility, making soccer an effective broad-spectrum fitness training intervention."

SRM power meters were used to monitor power output, cadence and speed. Data were averaged over the entire race, different durations prior to the sprint (60, 10, 5 and 1\u2009min) and during the actual sprint. Variations in power during the final 10\u2009min of the race were quantified using exposure variation analysis. This observational study was conducted in the field to maximize the ecological validity of the results. Power, cadence and speed were statistically different between various phases of the race (p<0.001), increasing from 316\u00b143\u2009W, 95\u00b14\u2009rpm and 50.5\u00b13.3\u2009km\u00b7h(-1) in the last 10\u2009min, to 487\u00b158\u2009W, 102\u00b16\u2009rpm and 55.4\u00b14.7\u2009km\u00b7h(-1) in the last min prior to the sprint. Peak power during the sprint was 17.4\u00b11.7\u2009W\u00b7kg(-1). Exposure variation analysis revealed a significantly greater number of short-duration high-intensity efforts in the final 5\u2009min of the race, compared with the penultimate 5\u2009min (p=0.010). These findings quantify the power output requirements associated with high-level sprinting in men's professional road cycling and highlight the need for both aerobic and anaerobic fitness."

We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to quantify the impact of exercise on cardiorespiratory fitness and a variety of conventional and novel cardiometabolic biomarkers in adults without cardiovascular disease.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Two researchers selected 160 randomized controlled trials (7487 participants) based on literature searches of Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Central (January 1965 to March 2014). Data were extracted using a standardized protocol. A random-effects meta-analysis and systematic review was conducted to evaluate the effects of exercise interventions on cardiorespiratory fitness and circulating biomarkers. Exercise significantly raised absolute and relative cardiorespiratory fitness. Lipid profiles were improved in exercise groups, with lower levels of triglycerides and higher levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1. Lower levels of fasting insulin, homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance, and glycosylated hemoglobin A1c were found in exercise groups. Compared with controls, exercise groups had higher levels of interleukin-18 and lower levels of leptin, fibrinogen, and angiotensin II. In addition, we found that the exercise effects were modified by age, sex, and health status such that people aged <50 years, men, and people with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, or metabolic syndrome appeared to benefit more.\nCONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis showed that exercise significantly improved cardiorespiratory fitness and some cardiometabolic biomarkers. The effects of exercise were modified by age, sex, and health status. Findings from this study have significant implications for future design of targeted lifestyle interventions."

A fly wheel braking force corresponding to 5% and 7.5% of the participants body weight was used for the upper and lower body WAnTs respectively. Oxygen uptake and blood lactate were measured before, during and after both WAnTs, and body composition was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA).\nRESULTS: The anaerobic lactic energy system contribution was significantly (P<0.01) higher during the upper body (60.3\u00b15.6%) compared to the lower body (46.9\u00b16.9%) WAnT. The contribution of the anaerobic alactic system was significantly higher (P<0.01) during the lower body (36.5\u00b16.3%) compared to the upper body (28.3\u00b14.9%) WAnT, with the aerobic system contribution significantly (P<0.05) higher for the lower body (16.8\u00b12.5%) compared to the upper body (11.4\u00b11.4%) WAnT.\nCONCLUSION: The anaerobic lactic energy system provides over 60% of the energy requirements during an upper body WAnT but provides less the 50% during the lower body WAnT. In contrast, the aerobic and anaerobic alactic energy system contribution was significantly less for the upper body WAnT compared to the lower body WAnT."

        "abstract_content": "Recently, a self-paced protocol demonstrated higher maximal oxygen uptake versus the traditional ramp protocol. The primary aim of the current study was to further explore potential differences in maximal oxygen uptake between the ramp and self-paced protocols using simultaneous measurement of cardiac output. Active men and women of various fitness levels (N = 30, mean age = 26.0 \u00b1 5.0 years) completed 3 graded exercise tests separated by a minimum of 48 h. Participants initially completed progressive ramp exercise to exhaustion to determine maximal oxygen uptake followed by a verification test to confirm maximal oxygen uptake attainment. Over the next 2 sessions, they performed a self-paced and an additional ramp protocol. During exercise, gas exchange data were obtained using indirect calorimetry, and thoracic impedance was utilized to estimate hemodynamic function (stroke volume and cardiac output). One-way ANOVA with repeated measures was used to determine differences in maximal oxygen uptake and cardiac output between ramp and self-paced testing. Results demonstrated lower (p < 0.001) maximal oxygen uptake via the ramp (47.2 \u00b1 10.2 mL\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1)) versus the self-paced (50.2 \u00b1 9.6 mL\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1)) protocol, with no interaction (p = 0.06) seen for fitness level. Maximal heart rate and cardiac output (p = 0.02) were higher in the self-paced protocol versus ramp exercise. In conclusion, data show that the traditional ramp protocol may underestimate maximal oxygen uptake compared with a newly developed self-paced protocol, with a greater cardiac output potentially responsible for this outcome."

We analysed data collected from the Spanish National Health Surveys conducted in 2006 (n=30,072) and 2011 (n=21,007), through self-reported information. The number of subjects aged \u226565 years included in the current study was n=5756 in 2006 (19.14%) and n=4617 in 2011 (21.97%). We included responses from adults aged 65 years and older.\nOUTCOME MEASURES: The main variables included leisure-time physical activity, walking up 10 steps, and walking for 1h. We analysed socio-demographic characteristics, individuals' self-rated health status, lifestyle habits, co-morbid conditions and disability using multivariable logistic regression models.\nRESULTS: The total number of subjects was 10,373 (6076 women, 4297 men). The probability of self-reported capacity was significantly higher in 2006 than in 2011 for leisure-time physical activity, walking up 10 steps, and walking for 1h for both sexes (women: OR 2.20, 95%IC 1.91-5.55; OR 2.50, 95%IC 1.99-3.14; OR 1.04, 95%IC 1.01-1.07; men: OR 2.20, 95%IC 1.91-2.55; OR 2.01, 95%IC 1.40-2.89; OR 1.05, 95%IC 1.0-1.1) respectively. Both sexes were associated with a significantly lower probability of performing leisure-time physical activity, walking up 10 steps, and walking for 1h. Additionally, those over 80 years of age, on average, showed a poor or very poor perception of their health and presented with some type of disability.\nCONCLUSION: A decrease in the proportion of respondents who self-reported undertaking leisure-time physical activity, walking up 10 steps, and walking for 1h was observed in the Spanish population of over 65 years between 2006 and 2011."

        "abstract_content": "BACKGROUND: Although the trajectory of blood pressure (BP) with aging is well known, there is a lack of data on how cardiorespiratory fitness (hereafter referred to as fitness) affects age-associated changes in BP.\nOBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to investigate whether fitness alters the aging-BP trajectory.\nMETHODS: A cohort from the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study totaling 13,953 men between 20 and 90 years of age who did not have hypertension, cardiovascular disease, or cancer completed 3 to 28 (mean of 3.8) follow-up medical examinations between 1970 and 2006. Fitness was measured by a maximal treadmill exercise test. Longitudinal data were analyzed using linear mixed models.\nRESULTS: Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) tended to increase until nearly 60 years of age, when a decrease was observed. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) tended to increase over all age periods. On multivariate analysis, average SBP increased by 0.30 mm\u00a0Hg (95% confidence interval: 0.29 to 0.31) with 1-year age increment after adjusting for body fat percent, fitness, resting heart rate, glucose level, triglyceride level, cholesterol level, current smoking, heavy alcohol consumption, and parental history of hypertension. DBP had a yearly increase of 0.14 mm\u00a0Hg (95% confidence interval: 0.13 to 0.15) before age 60 years. Overall, abnormal SBP (>120 mm\u00a0Hg) began to occur at approximately 50 years of age and abnormal DBP (>80 mm\u00a0Hg) began to occur at 60 years of age. Men with higher fitness levels experienced abnormal SBP later than those with low fitness levels.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore the potential modifying effect of fitness on BP trajectory with aging over the male adult life span. Improving fitness levels might extend the normal SBP and DBP ranges, delaying the development of hypertension."

These patients often present with metabolic disorders, which can improve with regular physical exercise. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a physical exercise program on the functional capacity of LTP.\nMETHOD: The distance walked in the 6-minute walk test and the resting energy expenditure (REE) were evaluated in 15 subjects who regularly attend the outpatient Bias Fortes Clinic at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais. The patients were divided into 2 groups, the Exercise Group (EG) (6 men and 3 women; 52 \u00b1 15 years old, BMI 22.4 \u00b1 4.0\u00a0kg/m\u00b2) performed 24 sessions of continuous 30\u00a0min treadmill exercise. Intensity of exercise was increased from 50%-70% of the maximum heart rate over the training period. A group of 3 men and 3 women (39 \u00b1 15 years, BMI 24.5 \u00b1 4.4\u00a0kg/m\u00b2) served as controls (CG).\nRESULTS: After undergoing exercise training, patients in the EG showed a 19.4% increase in the distance walked (pre\u00a0= 453.6 \u00b1 128.0\u00a0m and post\u00a0= 582.5 \u00b1 90.1\u00a0m).

Permeability may rise with intense exercise, yet some data indicate that endotoxemia may be mitigated with bovine colostrum supplementation. Using a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled crossover study, we tested whether bovine colostrum (COL; 1.7 g\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day(-1) for 7 days) would attenuate physiological strain and aid exercise capacity in the heat, especially in untrained individuals. Seven trained men (T; peak oxygen uptake 64 \u00b1 4 mL\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1)) and 8 untrained men (UT, peak oxygen uptake 46 \u00b1 4 mL\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1)) exercised for 90 min in 30 \u00b0C (50\u2009% relative humidity) after COL or placebo (corn flour). Exercise consisted of 15-min cycling at 50\u2009% heart rate reserve (HRR) before and after 60 min of running (30 min at 80\u2009% HRR then 30-min distance trial). Heart rate, blood pressure (Finometer), esophageal, and skin temperatures were recorded continuously. Gastrointestinal permeability was assessed from urine (double-sugar model, using high-performance liquid chromatography) and blood (intestinal fatty acid-binding protein, I-FABP). The T group ran \u223c2.4 km (35%) further than the UT group in the distance trial, and I-FABP increased more in the T group than in the UT group, but physiological and performance outcomes were unaffected by colostrum supplementation, irrespective of fitness. Circulating pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine concentrations were higher following exercise, but were not modulated by fitness or COL. Despite substantial thermal and cardiovascular strain incurred in environmental conditions in which exertional endotoxemia may occur, bovine colostrum supplementation had no observable benefit on the physiology or performance of either highly trained endurance athletes or untrained individuals."

However, the minimal threshold of muscle strength at which the risk for MetS increases has never been established.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify a threshold of muscle strength associated with MetS in men.\nMETHODS: We created receiver operating curves for muscle strength and the risk of MetS from a cross-sectional sample of 5685 men age <50 yr and 1541 men age \u226550 yr enrolled in the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study. The primary outcome measure, the MetS, was defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria. Upper and lower body muscle strength was treated as a composite measure of one-repetition maximum tests on bench and leg press and scaled to body weight. Low muscle strength was defined as the lowest age-specific 20th percentile, whereas high muscle strength was defined as composite muscle strength above the 20th percentile.\nRESULTS: In men aged <50 yr, the odds of MetS were 2.20-fold (95% confidence interval = 1.89-2.54) higher in those with low muscle strength, independent of age, smoking, and alcohol intake. The strength of this association was similar for men age \u226550 yr (odds ratio = 2.11, 95% confidence interval = 1.62-2.74). In men age < 50 yr, the composite strength threshold associated with MetS was 2.57 kg\u00b7kg body weight, whereas in men age \u2265 50 yr the threshold was 2.35 kg\u00b7kg body weight.\nCONCLUSION: This study is the first to identify a threshold of muscle strength associated with an increased likelihood of MetS in men. Measures of muscle strength may help identify men at risk of chronic disease."

The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of \u03b2-hydroxy-\u03b2-methylbutyric free acid (HMBFA) and cycle ergometry HIIT on maximal oxygen consumption (VO2peak), ventilatory threshold (VT), respiratory compensation point (RCP) and time to exhaustion (Tmax) in college-aged men and women.\nMETHODS: Thirty-four healthy men and women (Age: 22.7\u2009\u00b1\u20093.1\u00a0yrs ; VO2peak: 39.3\u2009\u00b1\u20095.0\u00a0ml\u2009\u00b7\u2009kg(-1)\u2009\u00b7\u2009min(-1)) volunteered to participate in this double-blind, placebo-controlled design study. All participants completed a series of tests prior to and following treatment. A peak oxygen consumption test was performed on a cycle ergometer to assess VO2peak, Tmax, VT, and RCP. Twenty-six participants were randomly assigned into either a placebo (PLA-HIIT) or 3\u00a0g per day of HMBFA (BetaTor\u2122) (HMBFA-HIIT) group. Eight participants served as controls (CTL). Participants in the HIIT groups completed 12 HIIT (80-120% maximal workload) exercise sessions consisting of 5-6 bouts of a 2:1\u00a0minute cycling work to rest ratio protocol over a four-week period. Body composition was measured with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Outcomes were assessed by ANCOVA with posttest means adjusted for pretest differences.\nRESULTS: The HMBFA-HIIT intervention showed significant (p\u2009<\u20090.05) gains in VO2peak, and VT, versus the CTL and PLA-HIIT group. Both PLA-HIIT and HMBFA-HIIT treatment groups demonstrated significant (p\u2009<\u20090.05) improvement over CTL for Tmax, and RCP with no significant difference between the treatment groups. There were no significant differences observed for any measures of body composition. An independent-samples t-test confirmed that there were no significant differences between the training volumes for the PLA-HIIT and HMBFA-HIIT groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the use of HIIT in combination with HMBFA to improve aerobic fitness in college age men and women. These data suggest that the addition of HMBFA supplementation may result in greater changes in VO2peak and VT than HIIT alone.\nSTUDY REGISTRATION: The study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (ID NCT01941368)."

        "authors": "Lambert EV, Kolbe-Alexander TL",
        "year": 2013,
        "abstract_content": "Over 50% of South African adult women and 30% of adult men are either overweight or obese, and nearly half of all adults are insufficiently active, with major increases in obesity-associated healthcare expenditures since 1980, a high proportion of which are paid by private health insurance. In this paper, we describe the Vitality programme, an incentivized health promotion programme from South Africa's largest private health insurer, Discovery Health, with over 2.5 million beneficiaries. Wellness activities of the programme include health risk assessments, subsidized gym memberships and smoking cessation or weight loss programmes with many incentives, including cash back on purchases of healthy foods. This incentive-based programme has shown a significant relationship between levels of engagement in wellness activities, in particular increasing participation in fitness-related activities, with lower healthcare expenditure and an increase in the overall ratio of healthy foods to total food purchases. This programme demonstrates that incentives may reduce the barriers for entry into care, increase preventive screening and increase engagement in healthy behaviours for prevention and management of obesity. This 'carrots versus sticks' approach may have implications for public health policy even in lower- and middle-income settings and underserved communities."

The highest oxygen pulses were observed in the 3 youngest age groups (20-29 years, 30-39 years, 40-49 years) among men and women; 22.3 mL\u00b7beat(-1)\u00b13.6 and 14.7 mL\u00b7beat(-1)\u00b12.7 (sex differences, p<0.001), respectively, with no significant difference between these age groups. After the age of 50 we observed an 8% reduction per decade among both sexes. Borg scores appear to give a good estimate of the relative exercise intensity, although observing a slightly different relationship than reported in previous reference material from small populations.\nCONCLUSION: This is the largest European reference material of objectively measured parameters of aerobic fitness and exercise-physiology in healthy men and women aged 20-90 years, forming the basis for an easily accessible, valid and understandable tool for improved training prescription in healthy men and women."

All individuals participated in 60-minute physiotherapy sessions 5 times weekly as inpatients for 6 weeks and 3 times weekly as outpatients for another 6 weeks. Baseline, posttraining, 6-, and 12-month follow-up outcome measures were as follows: primary, fitness (peak oxygen consumption, VO2peak) and walking ability (6-Minute Walk Test [6MWT] and 10-m walk); secondary, Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and motor impairment (Chedoke-McMaster Stages of Recovery [CMSR] Leg and Foot).\nRESULTS: In all, 50 individuals (mean age, 60 \u00b1 14 years; mean event-to-randomization, 23 \u00b1 5 days; 29 men) participated. No adverse events occurred. BWSTT improved VO2peak by 30%, which was significantly greater than the 8% improvement observed for UC (P = .004 between groups). Similarly, there were significant Time \u00d7 Group interactions for 6MWT and CMSR Foot, with BWSTT outperforming UC for gains in distance (P = .15; 48% vs. 19%, respectively) and stage (P = .01; 1.0 vs. 0.3, respectively). No group effect was seen for 10-m walk speed, BBS, or CMSR Leg, with both groups demonstrating significant gains. In general, gains observed were preserved for 12 months.\nCONCLUSIONS: BWSTT elicits greater improvements in cardiovascular fitness and walking endurance than UC in the subacute poststroke period. These gains are largely sustained for 1 year."

        "year": 2014,
        "abstract_content": "PURPOSE: This study examined the effect of the type, level and amount of physical activity in falls and fall-related injuries.\nMETHOD: Participants were 506 community-dwelling adults aged >50 years (390 women: 67.7 \u00b1 6.8 years and 116 men: 69.6 \u00b1 6.6 years). Falls, fall-related injuries (slight and severe), and physical activity (type, level and energy expenditure) were evaluated by questionnaires. Confounders included co-morbidities, fear of falling, environmental hazards and physical fitness.\nRESULTS: After adjustment for confounders, logistic analysis revealed that the likelihood of falling decreased by 2% for each 100 metabolic expenditure (MET-min/week) of total physical activity and increased by 5% for each 100 MET-min/week of vigorous-intensity physical activity; total physical activity >1125 MET-min/week and vigorous physical activity <500 MET-min/week were identified as cut-off values discriminating non-fallers from fallers. Compared to the low physical activity level, increased physical activity levels diminished the likelihood of the occurrence of severe fall-related injuries by 76% (moderate) and 58% (high; p < 0.05) in fallers.\nCONCLUSIONS: Being active, especially sufficiently active, reduces fall-related injuries by decreasing falls and by safeguarding against severe injuries when falls occur. At least 1125 MET-min/week of total physical activity including >500 MET-min/week of vigorous intensity seems to prevent falls and, therefore, fall-related injuries."

The objective of this study was to examine the association between aerobic (physical) fitness and risk of hospitalisation due to HLDD in a long-term follow up.\nMETHODS: The Copenhagen Male Study is a prospective cohort study established in 1970-71. At baseline, 5,249 men answered a questionnaire about their history of back disease, physical and psychosocial working conditions, lifestyle and social class. Height and weight was measured and aerobic capacity (physical fitness) was estimated based on a submaximal bicycle test. Information about hospitalization due to HLDD was obtained from the National Hospital Register covering the period 1977 - 2003. Hazard Ratios (HR) were calculated by Cox's proportional hazard regression model.\nRESULTS: Among 3,833 men without history of low back disorders, 64 were hospitalized due to HLDD. The cumulative incidence of HLDD was 1.7% (n=34) among men with low physical fitness (15-32 ml O2*min-1*kg-1), and 1.7% (n=30) among men with high physical fitness (33-78 ml O2*min-1*kg-1). In a final model, adjusted for relevant confounders, the HR (95% CI) for HLDD for those with high physical fitness was 0.88 (0.51-1.50) compared to those with low physical fitness. In the same model, HR for men often exposed to strenuous work compared to those seldom or never exposed to strenuous work was 3.91(1.82-8.38). Also body height was a significant predictor.\nCONCLUSIONS: Physical fitness is not associated with hospitalisation due to HLDD, and the only modifiable risk factor for hospitalisation due to HLDD seems to be strenuousness at work."

During each session, resting VO2, exercise VO2, and a 180-min post-exercise VO2 were measured. The net exercise VO2 during the SIT, HIAT, and CAT averaged 14.7 \u00b1 1.5, 31.8 \u00b1 4.1, and 71.1 \u00b1 10.0 L, and the EPOCs averaged 6.8 \u00b1 4.0, 4.5 \u00b1 3.3, and 2.9 \u00b1 2.8 L, respectively. The EPOC with SIT was greater than with CAT (P < 0.01) and HIAT (P = 0.12). Correlation coefficients obtained between subjects' VO2max and the ratio of EPOC to net exercise VO2 for SIT, HIAT, and CAT were -0.61 (P = 0.06), -0.79 (P < 0.01), and -0.42 (P = 0.23), respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that cardiorespiratory fitness level correlates negatively with the magnitude of EPOC, especially when performing aerobic-type interval training."

Prognostic factors of long-term cardiovascular risk are needed for low-risk subjects who make up the largest percentage of the US population.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: The study population was composed of men and women, 30 to 50 years of age, who had a baseline medical exam at the Cooper Clinic, Dallas, TX, between 1970 and 1983. Eligible individuals were defined as at low risk for coronary heart disease by Framingham Risk Score at the time of study entry and had no history of diabetes (n=11 190). Cardiorespiratory fitness was determined by maximum graded exercise treadmill tests. Over an average 27\u00b12-year period, 15% of low-fit (quintile 1) compared to 6% of high-fit (quintile 5) individuals died (P<0.001). A 1-metabolic equivalent level increase in baseline fitness was associated with an 11% reduction in all-cause deaths and an 18% reduction in deaths due to cardiovascular disease (CVD) after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, blood glucose levels, smoking, and early family history of coronary disease. There was an incremental decrease in CVD risk with increasing fitness quintile, such that the high fit had the lowest adjusted 30-year CVD mortality rate (hazard ratio 0.29, 95% CI: 0.16-0.51) compared to the low fit.\nCONCLUSIONS: Cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with a significant reduction in long-term CVD among individuals identified as low risk by Framingham Risk Score. These data suggest that preventive lifestyle interventions geared to optimize cardiorespiratory fitness, even among a \"low-risk\" subset, should be considered to improve CVD-free survival.

        "abstract_content": "Ingestion of an acute dose of phosphate has been shown to attenuate energy intake in the subsequent meal. This raises the question of whether the practice of phosphate supplementation over a number of days by athletes to enhance performance also influences energy intake. This study investigated the effect of 6 d of phosphate supplementation on appetite and energy intake, as well as aerobic capacity, in trained individuals. Twenty participants completed two 6-d phases of supplementation with either sodium phosphate (50 mg/kg of fat-free mass per day) or a placebo in a double-blinded, counterbalanced design. On Days 1, 2, and 6 of supplementation, a laboratory meal was provided to assess appetite and ad libitum energy intake. All other food and drink consumed during each supplementation phase were recorded in a food diary. After the 6 d of supplementation, peak aerobic capacity (VO(2peak)) was assessed. There was no difference in energy intake at the laboratory meal after an acute dose (i.e., on Day 1; placebo 2,471 \u00b1 919 kJ, phosphate 2,353 \u00b1 987 kJ; p = .385) or prolonged supplementation with sodium phosphate (p = .581) compared with placebo. Likewise, there was no difference in VO(2peak) with phosphate supplementation (placebo 52.6 \u00b1 5.2 ml \u00b7 kg(-1) \u00b7 min(-1), phosphate 53.3 \u00b1 6.1 ml \u00b7 kg(-1) \u00b7 min(-1); p = .483). In summary, 6 d of sodium phosphate supplementation does not appear to influence energy intake. Therefore, athletes supplementing with sodium phosphate can do so without hindering their nutritional status. However, given that phosphate supplementation failed to improve aerobic capacity, the ergogenic benefit of this supplement remains questionable."

A single national (Spanish) registry of patients with McArdle disease was created with the purpose of analysing their genotypic and phenotypic characteristics.\nMETHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted, collecting demographic, family history, clinical, genotype and functional capacity data from all patients diagnosed with McArdle disease in the Spanish National Health System up to December 2010.\nRESULTS: 239 cases were recorded (all of Caucasian descent, 102 women; mean\u00b1SD age 44\u00b118 years (range 9, 93)); prevalence of \u223c1/167\u2008000 people. Two mutant PYGM alleles were identified in 99.6% of cases. Although there was heterogeneity in the severity of symptoms, there were four common diagnostic features: (1) 99.5% of patients reported a history of acute crises of exercise intolerance (accompanied by recurrent myoglobinuria in 50% of cases); (2) in 58% of patients, symptoms started in the first decade of life; (3) 86% of patients repeatedly experienced the 'second wind' phenomenon over life; and (4) 99% of patients had a high basal serum level of total creatine kinase (>200 U/l). Clinical presentation of the disease was similar in men and women and worsened with age. Patients who were physically active had higher levels of cardiorespiratory fitness (by 23%, p=0.003) and were more likely to improve their clinical course over a 4 year period compared with inactive patients (OR 225; 95% CI 20.3 to 2496.7).\nCONCLUSIONS: The main clinical features of McArdle disease are generally homogeneous and frequently appear during childhood; clinical condition deteriorates with ageing.

Subjects performed the chest shake (CS), biceps shake (BS), and triceps shake (TS) using the SW and DW. Maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) were exhibited for all muscles. EMG activity was recorded for the pectoralis major (PM), triceps brachii (TB), biceps brachii (BB), anterior deltoid (AD), trapezius (TR), and rectus abdominus (RA) and compared to detect differences between modalities. EMG activity for each muscle group was reported as a percentage of each subject's individual MVIC. A repeated measures ANOVA revealed no significant differences between the SW and DB modalities during each exercise for all muscles except the BB (p < 0.05). During the CS exercise muscle activity was significantly greater for DB in the BB muscle when compared to the SW mode (50.8 \u00b1 28.9%; 35.8 \u00b1 30.8%). The SW did not have any advantage over the DB for any exercise, nor for any muscle group. Further, no muscle group during any of the SW trials exhibited an MVIC over 60%, the level necessary to increase muscular strength."

Last training session of each training day was immediately followed by 5 min of seated recovery, in randomized order, with CWI (15\u00b0C) or without (CON). Each morning before the first training session (6:30 AM) during the two experimental weeks, subjective ratings of well-being (eg, quality of sleep) were assessed and the R-R intervals were recorded for 5 min in supine position. A vagal-related index (ie, natural logarithm of the square root of the mean of the sum of the squares of differences between adjacent normal R-R intervals; Ln rMSSD) was calculated from the last 3-min segment.\nRESULTS: Compared with CON, CWI effect on Ln rMSSD was rated as possibly beneficial on day 2 [7.0% (-3; 19)], likely beneficial on day 3 [20.0% (1.5; 43.5)], very likely beneficial on day 4 [30.4% (12.2; 51.6)] and likely beneficial on day 5 [24.1% (-0.4; 54.8)]. Cold water immersion was associated with a likely greater quality of sleep on day 2 [30.0% (2.7; 64.6)], very likely on day 3 [31.0% (5.0; 63.1)] and likely on day 4 [38.6% (11.4; 72.4)] when compared with CON.\nCONCLUSION: Five minutes of CWI following training can reduce the usual exercise-induced decrease in parasympathetic activity and is associated with improved rating of perceived sleep quality."

        "abstract_content": "PURPOSE: Exercise has been proposed as an effective countermeasure for androgen suppression therapy induced side effects. Since the magnitude of fat gain and muscle loss is most pronounced during the early phases of androgen suppression therapy, the exercise response may differ by the duration of androgen suppression therapy. We investigated whether the exercise response varied by the prior duration of exposure to androgen suppression therapy, that is acute--less than 6 months vs later--6 months or greater.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 50 men 55 to 84 years old undergoing androgen suppression therapy for nonbone metastatic prostate cancer completed a progressive resistance and cardiovascular exercise program for 12 weeks, including 16 with acute and 34 with chronic androgen suppression therapy exposure. We assessed fat and lean mass by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry as well as muscle strength, functional performance, quality of life and blood biomarkers.\nRESULTS: Patients on acute androgen suppression showed an increase in total body fat compared to those on chronic androgen suppression (0.9 kg, p = 0.018). Each group experienced increased appendicular skeletal muscle (about 0.5 kg, p <0.01). Triglycerides decreased in the chronic group and increased in the acute group (p = 0.027). Change in triglycerides were associated with the change in total body fat (r = 0.411, p = 0.004). There were no differences between the groups in prostate specific antigen, testosterone, glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, low and high density lipoprotein, cholesterol, C-reactive protein, homocysteine or quality of life. The 2 groups showed similar improvement in muscle strength and function, and cardiovascular fitness.\nCONCLUSIONS: Apart from differences in body fat and triglycerides the beneficial effects of exercise are similar in patients on acute or chronic androgen suppression therapy."

However, current reference values are either estimates of oxygen uptake or come from small studies, mainly of men. Therefore, the aims of this study were to directly measure VO2peak in healthy adult men and women and to assess the association with cardiovascular risk factor levels.\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional study of 4631 volunteering, free-living Norwegian men (n = 2368) and women (n = 2263) age 20-90 yr. The data collection was from June 2007 to June 2008. Participants were free from known pulmonary or cardiovascular disease. VO2peak was measured by ergospirometry during treadmill running. Associations (odds ratios, OR) with unfavorable levels of cardiovascular risk factors and a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors were assessed by logistic regression analysis.\nRESULTS: Overall, mean VO2peak was 40.0 \u00b1 9.5 mL\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1). Women below the median VO2peak (<35.1 mL\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1)) were five times (OR = 5.4, 95% confidence interval = 2.3-12.9) and men below the median (<44.2 mL\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1)) were eight times (OR = 7.9, 95% confidence interval = 3.5-18.0) more likely to have a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors compared to those in the highest quartile of VO2peak (\u226540.8 and \u226550.5 mL\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1) in women and men, respectively). Each 5-mL\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1) lower VO2peak corresponded to \u223c56% higher odds of cardiovascular risk factor clustering.\nCONCLUSIONS: These data represent the largest reference material of objectively measured VO2peak in healthy men and women age 20-90 yr. Even in people considered to be fit, VO2peak was clearly associated with levels of conventional cardiovascular risk factors."

        "abstract_content": "The reduced gait stability and aerobic fitness of people with Down syndrome (DS) may increase their rate of gross oxygen uptake (gross-VO(2)) during over-ground walking. If so, the ACSM equation predicting gross-VO(2) from speed may not be appropriate and an equation specifically for these individuals may be needed. This study therefore examined whether the relationship between gross-VO(2) and speed differs between individuals with and without DS during over-ground walking and attempted to develop a gross-VO(2) prediction equation for people with DS. Gross-VO(2) was measured in 18 persons with DS (24.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.8\u00a0years; 8 men) and 22 persons without DS (25.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.8\u00a0years; 9 men) at rest and during five over-ground walking trials, each lasting 6\u00a0min, at 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, and 1.5\u00a0m/s. Multi-level modeling with random intercepts and slopes demonstrated significant effects of speed, group, group-by-speed interaction, and speed squared (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In each group, actual gross-VO(2) did not differ from gross-VO(2) predicted by the regression equation across speeds. Bland-Altman plots showed somewhat greater variability in the difference between actual and predicted gross-VO(2) for participants with DS. Mean absolute error of prediction was 10.75 and 10.67% for participants with and without DS, respectively. In participants with DS, the ACSM formula under-estimated gross-VO(2) across speeds, whereas, in participants without DS, only at 1.5\u00a0m/s (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Therefore, individuals with DS show altered curvilinear gross-VO(2) to speed relationship during over-ground walking. The present regression equation appears to offer accurate prediction in people with DS and could be used for prescribing over-ground walking intensities."

        "year": 2010,
        "abstract_content": "AIM: The limited potential of exercise to induce weight loss could be partly due to the overestimation of the energy cost of exercise. The objectives of this study were twofold: 1) to investigate whether men and women are able to accurately estimate exercise energy expenditure (EE); and 2) to determine whether they have the ability to accurately compensate for the EE of exercise during a buffet-type meal.\nMETHODS: Sixteen (8 men, 8 women) moderately active (VO2 peak=45.4\u00b17.7 mL.kg-1.min-1), normal weight (BMI=22.8\u00b13.3 kg/m2) individuals, aged 20-35 years, were studied. They were blinded to two randomly assigned experimental conditions: a 200 and a 300 kcal (measured by indirect calorimetry) exercise sessions that were performed on a treadmill at the same intensity (50% of VO2 peak). At the end of each exercise session individuals were asked to estimate EE of the exercise sessions and to then eat the caloric equivalent of their estimated exercise EE from a buffet-type meal.\nRESULTS: Estimated EE was higher than measured EE for both the 200 kcal (825.0\u00b11061.8 vs. 200.1\u00b10.7 kcal, P<0.05) and 300 kcal (896.9\u00b1952.4 vs. 300.2\u00b10.7 kcal, P<0.05) sessions. Further, post-exercise energy intake was higher than measured EE for the 200 kcal (556.8\u00b1204.4 vs. 200.1\u00b10.7 kcal, P<0.001) and the 300 kcal (607.2\u00b1166.5 vs. 300.2\u00b10.7 kcal, P<0.001) sessions. Although post-exercise energy intake was lower than estimated EE, no significant differences were noted.\nCONCLUSION: These results suggest that normal weight individuals overestimate EE during exercise by 3-4 folds. Further, when asked to precisely compensate for exercise EE with food intake, the resulting energy intake is still 2 to 3 folds greater than the measured EE of exercise."

Physical function was assessed with the 6-minute walk test (6MWT), grip strength, and the timed-up-and-go (TUG) test, representing endurance and upper and lower extremity strength, respectively. Quality of life (QOL) was measured with the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire. Subjects were assessed at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. Two control groups (PC without ADT; no PC), matched on age, education, and baseline function were enrolled. Mixed effects regression models were fitted, adjusting for baseline covariates.\nRESULTS: We enrolled 87 patients on ADT, 86 PC controls, and 86 healthy controls; groups were similar in age (mean, 69.1 years; range, 50 to 87) and physical function. The 6MWT distance remained stable in the ADT group (P = .96) but improved in both control groups (P < .05). Grip strength declined in the ADT group (P = .04), remained stable in PC controls (P = .31), and improved in healthy controls (P = .008). TUG scores remained stable over time and across groups (P > .10). The SF-36 physical function summary score declined in the ADT group (P < .001), but increased in both control groups (P < .001). Negative effects on outcomes were observed within 3 months of starting ADT and were generally independent of age.\nCONCLUSION: Endurance, upper extremity strength, and physical components of QOL are affected within 3 months of starting ADT. Up-front exercise interventions to counteract these losses are warranted."

        "abstract_content": "AIM: Forward flexibility of the trunk (FFT) is used as an indicator of vertebral function and assessed using the sit-and-reach and fingertip-ground tests.\nMETHODS: FFT was investigated in adolescents and comparisons were made among genders, sitting and standing positions, and low and high speed; 102 males and females (16 to 20 years of age) participated in the study.\nRESULTS: The position of the body and gender factor had no influence over the flexibility assessment. When executed slowly, the values obtained in the test were significantly lower; 60% of the participants were unable to reach their feet in the slow form and 50% were unable to reach their feet in the fast form. Thus, the assessment of vertebral function in adolescents should not use the ability to reach their feet as a criterion of normality. The fingertip-ground and sit-and-reach tests proved to be equally adequate. Greater height and length of limbs are associated to lower FFT values. Greater height and lower trunk-head height explain the lesser FFT in women; greater length of the lower limbs and lesser arm span explain the results for men.\nCONCLUSIONS: Reaching the feet in either the standing or sitting position is a criterion that excludes approximately 50% of adolescents from the normality of vertebral function, whereas reaching 12 cm above the ground is achieved by 90% of the population. Therefore, the criteria for assessing FFT in adolescents need to be reviewed."

All-cause mortality in age groups 50 to 65 (Group 1; n=1,658) and older than 65 (Group 2; n=1,209) was analyzed using adjusted Cox proportional hazards models.\nRESULTS: After a mean \u00b1 standard deviation follow-up period of 7.8 \u00b1 5.1 years, there were 324 deaths in Group 1 (20%) and 464 in Group 2 (38%). For each 1-MET increase in exercise capacity, mortality was 18% lower for the entire cohort (hazard ratio (HR)=0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.79-0.86), 23% lower for Group 1 (HR=0.77, 95% CI=0.73-0.82), and 16% lower for Group 2 (HR=0.84, 95% CI=0.8-0.89). When fitness categories were considered, the mortality risk was 30% to 80% lower for those who achieved more than 4 METs in both age groups.\nCONCLUSION: Augmented exercise capacity is associated with lower risk of mortality in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus aged 50 to 65 as well as in those older than 65. Thus, physical fitness, as represented by exercise capacity, lowers mortality risk in people with diabetes mellitus irrespective of age. These findings suggest that healthcare providers should be cognizant of the level of exercise capacity in individual patients and encourage a physically active lifestyle regardless of age."

The information available in older individuals is limited.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Between 1986 and 2008, we assessed the association between exercise capacity and all-cause mortality in 5314 male veterans aged 65 to 92 years (mean+/-SD, 71.4+/-5.0 years) who completed an exercise test at the Veterans Affairs Medical Centers in Washington, DC, and Palo Alto, Calif. We established fitness categories based on peak metabolic equivalents (METs) achieved. During a median 8.1 years of follow-up (range, 0.1 to 25.3), there were 2137 deaths. Baseline exercise capacity was 6.3+/-2.4 METs among survivors and 5.3+/-2.0 METs in those who died (P<0.001) and emerged as a strong predictor of mortality. For each 1-MET increase in exercise capacity, the adjusted hazard for death was 12% lower (hazard ratio=0.88; confidence interval, 0.86 to 0.90). Compared with the least fit individuals (< or =4 METs), the mortality risk was 38% lower for those who achieved 5.1 to 6.0 METs (hazard ratio=0.62; confidence interval, 0.54 to 0.71) and progressively declined to 61% (hazard ratio=0.39; confidence interval, 0.32 to 0.49) for those who achieved >9 METs, regardless of age. Unfit individuals who improved their fitness status with serial testing had a 35% lower mortality risk (hazard ratio=0.65; confidence interval, 0.46 to 0.93) compared with those who remained unfit.\nCONCLUSIONS: Exercise capacity is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in older men. The relationship is inverse and graded, with most survival benefits achieved in those with an exercise capacity >5 METs. Survival improved significantly when unfit individuals became fit."

The training sessions were performed 14 days apart and allocated in a counter-balanced order. Hormonal (plasma insulin, growth hormone [GH], testosterone and cortisol) and metabolic (blood glucose and lactate) responses were assessed before and after each exercise bout.

        "abstract_content": "Social influences can impact self-presentational concerns such as social physique anxiety (SPA), concerns over one's body being evaluated by others. In addition, social influences may also impact performance on a physical test. In a physical testing environment, one social factor that influences SPA and which may also influence the outcomes of a physical test is experimenter gender. The present study examined the influence of experimenter gender on SPA and actual muscle strength in an experimental testing environment. Male (n = 50) and female (n = 50) university students were randomly assigned to either a male or female experimenter. Before strength testing, state SPA (SPA-S) was assessed. Actual strength was represented by the score obtained during the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) test. Two 2 \u00d7 2 (participant gender \u00d7 gender of the experimenter) analyses of variance were conducted with SPA-S and strength as the dependent variables. For SPA-S, a significant main effect was found only for participant gender (F(1,95) = 14.08, p < 0.01, \u03b7\u00b2 = 0.13), with women scoring significantly higher than men. For MVC, there was a significant effect for participant gender (F(1,96) = 48.08, p < 0.001, \u03b7\u00b2 = 0.33), with men, as expected, having significantly higher strength values than women. Although the gender of the experimenter did not influence SPA-S or muscle strength, other forms of anxiety (e.g., fitness anxiety) may be relevant in this setting. Future research should also investigate other factors in the testing environment (e.g., type of task) that may be more influential on psychological or performance outcomes."

This study evaluated a combined exercise program that would be consistent with current cardiac rehabilitation guidelines. The program consisted of progressive resistance training (intensity progressing from 50 to 80% maximum) and aerobic conditioning (70% of heart rate reserve). Outcomes included muscular strength measured as 8-repetition maximum and submaximal aerobic fitness indicators (measured at 50% of predicted maximal oxygen consumption) including heart rate, blood pressure, and rate pressure product. Subjects were taken retrospectively from a database of CHF patients who underwent cardiac rehabilitation between 1998 and 2004 with the Cardiac Rehabilitation Center of River Cities Cardiology in Jeffersonville, IN. The same data set was used to evaluate 2 research questions: to compare training outcomes between gender (men and women) and to compare outcomes between young (<or=65 years) and old (>65 years) subjects. Forty-two subjects (15 women and 27 men; 19 were <or=65 and 23 were >65 years of age) met inclusion and exclusion criteria and underwent 36 sessions of cardiac rehabilitation over a 14-week time period. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to test whether strength and submaximal responses differed across gender or age. Analysis indicated that regardless of gender or age, subjects significantly increased their strength on each of 6 strength tests. Heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and rate pressure product were lower after training indicating increased aerobic efficiency. Progressive resistance training and aerobic conditioning prescribed in a manner consistent with cardiac rehabilitation guidelines resulted in similar improvements regardless of gender or age for individuals with CHF suggesting that no training program adjustments are necessary to accommodate age or gender."

Training consisted of 30-45 min of cycle ergometry at 50-70% maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), 3 times weekly for 16 wk, then 4 wk detraining, or assignment to a nontraining control group (n = 12 both groups). Training increased leg strength, leg power, upper leg muscle mass, and VO2max above pretraining values (21%, 12%, 4%, and 15%, respectively; p < .05). However, all gains were lost after detraining, except for some gain in VO2max. This suggests that cycle ergometry is sufficient stimulus to improve neuromuscular function in older men, but gains are quickly lost with detraining. For the older population cycle ergometry provides the means to not only increase aerobic fitness but also increase leg strength and power and upper leg muscle mass. However, during periods of inactivity neuromuscular gains are quickly lost."

Compared with men with zero positive health factors, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) of all-cause mortality with one, two, three, four, and five positive health factors were 0.78 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.64-0.95), 0.61 (95% CI = 0.50-0.73), 0.54 (95% CI = 0.44-0.65), 0.43 (95% CI = 0.35-0.52), and 0.39 (95% CI = 0.31-0.48), respectively (P for trend <0.001). The combination of five positive health factors accounted for 29% (95% CI = 14%-40%) of population-attributable risk for all-cause mortality.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that targeting more of these modifiable health factors may provide substantial health benefits in middle-aged men."

        "abstract_content": "PURPOSE: To determine if 16 weeks of strength training can improve the cardiovascular function of older men during submaximum aerobic exercise.\nMETHODS: Twenty four men aged 70-80 yr were randomly assigned to a strength training (ST; n = 12) and control group (C; n = 12). Training consisted of 3 sets of 6 - 10 repetitions at 70% to 90% of 1RM, 3 times per week, on an incline squat machine for 16 weeks, followed by 4 weeks detraining. Leg strength and maximum oxygen consumption (VO2 max) were assessed every 4 weeks of the 20-week study. Cardiovascular function was assessed during submaximum cycle exercise at 40 Watts, 50% and 70% of VO2 max before training, after 16 weeks training, and after 4 weeks detraining.\nRESULTS: At 40 Watts, heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure, and rate pressure product (RPP) were lower and stroke volume (SV) significantly higher after 16 weeks training and 4 weeks detraining: at 50% VO2 max, HR and RPP were lower after 16 weeks training and 4 weeks detraining: at 70% VO2 max, cycle ergometry power, VO2 and arterio-venous oxygen difference (a - vO2 ) were higher after 16 weeks training. Leg strength and VO2 max increased after 16 weeks training, with leg strength remaining above pre-training levels after 4-weeks detraining.\nCONCLUSIONS: Sixteen weeks of strength training significantly improves the cardiovascular function of older men. Therefore strength training not only increases muscular strength and hypertrophy but also provides significant cardiovascular benefits for older individuals."

        "abstract_content": "Increased cardiac troponin I (cTnI), a marker for cardiac damage, has been reported after strenuous exercise in young subjects. However, little is known about changes in cTnI after moderate-intensity exercise in a heterogenous population or which factors may contribute to this change in cTnI levels. We examined cTnI levels before and immediately after each day of a 4-day long-distance walking event (30 to 50 km/day) in a heterogenous group (67 men, 42 women), across a broad age range (21 to 82 years), with known cardiovascular pathology or risk factors present in many subjects (n = 24). Walking was performed at a self-selected pace. Cardiac TnI was assessed using a standard system (Immulite) with high values (>or=0.20 microg/L) cross-checked using a high-sensitive cTnI assay (Centaur). Mean cTnI levels increased significantly from 0.04 to 0.07 microg/L on day 1, with no further increase thereafter (p <0.001, analysis of variance). Backward linear regression found a weak, but significant, association of age (p <0.001), walking speed (p = 0.02), and cardiovascular pathology (p = 0.03) with postexercise cTnI level (combined r(2) = 0.11, p <0.001). In 6 participants (6%), cTnI was increased above the clinical cut-off value for myocardial infarction on >or=1 day. These participants supported the regression analysis, because they were older, walked at higher relative exercise intensity, and reported a high prevalence of cardiovascular pathology. In conclusion, prolonged, moderate-intensity exercise may result in an increase in cTnI levels in a broad spectrum of subjects, especially in older subjects with pre-existing cardiovascular disease or risk factors."

Intervention Participants were randomized either to a high-intensity aerobic exercise or stretching control group. The aerobic group exercised under the supervision of a fitness trainer at 75% to 85% of heart rate reserve for 45 to 60 min/d, 4 d/wk for 6 months. The control group carried out supervised stretching activities according to the same schedule but maintained their heart rate at or below 50% of their heart rate reserve. Before and after the study, glucometabolic and treadmill tests were performed and fat distribution was assessed using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. At baseline, month 3, and month 6, blood was collected for assay and cognitive tests were administered.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Performance measures on Symbol-Digit Modalities, Verbal Fluency, Stroop, Trails B, Task Switching, Story Recall, and List Learning. Fasting plasma levels of insulin, cortisol, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, insulinlike growth factor-I, and beta-amyloids 40 and 42.\nRESULTS: Six months of high-intensity aerobic exercise had sex-specific effects on cognition, glucose metabolism, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and trophic activity despite comparable gains in cardiorespiratory fitness and body fat reduction. For women, aerobic exercise improved performance on multiple tests of executive function, increased glucose disposal during the metabolic clamp, and reduced fasting plasma levels of insulin, cortisol, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. For men, aerobic exercise increased plasma levels of insulinlike growth factor I and had a favorable effect only on Trails B performance.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study provides support, using rigorous controlled methodology, for a potent nonpharmacologic intervention that improves executive control processes for older women at high risk of cognitive decline. Moreover, our results suggest that a sex bias in cognitive response may relate to sex-based differences in glucometabolic and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis responses to aerobic exercise."

Healthy, inactive adults (n = 50) aged 65 years and older underwent strength, power, total body composition (% fat and fat free mass [FFM]), and physical function testing before and after 22 weeks of ST. Physical function testing consisted of tasks designed to mimic common physical activities of daily living (ADL). To improve internal validity of the assessment of mid-thigh intermuscular fat, subcutaneous fat, and knee extensors MV, a 10-week unilateral ST program using the untrained leg as an internal control preceded 12 weeks of whole-body ST. Strength, power, and FFM increased significantly with ST (all p < 0.05), whereas rapid walk, 5 chair stands, and get up and go time decreased significantly with ST in the overall group (all p < 0.05). Women improved significantly in both walking test times (both p < 0.05) but not in the stair climb test, whereas men improved in the stair climb test (p < 0.05) but not in walking test times. Multiple regression analysis revealed the highest R (0.28) for the change in chair stands time, followed by stair climb and usual walk at 0.27 and 0.21, respectively. ST improves performance in functional tasks important for ADLs. Changes in strength, power, and FFM are predictors of ST-induced improvements in these tasks."

VO(2)peak was lower in subjects with hypertension (16%, P<.01) and moderate anemia (hemoglobin 10-13 gm/dL; 15%, P=.09) than in subjects without these conditions. CD4 cell count (median 356 cells/mL, range 20-1,401) and HIV-1 viral load (84% nondetectable) were not related to VO(2)peak. Among muscle parameters, only grip strength was an independent predictor of VO(2)peak. Estimation of VO(2)peak using linear regression, including age, 6-MWD, grip strength, and hypertension as independent variables, explained 61% of the variance in VO(2)peak.\nCONCLUSION: Non-AIDS-related comorbidity predicts cardiorespiratory fitness in older HIV-infected men receiving ARV therapy. The 6-MWD is a valuable measure of fitness in this patient population, but a larger study with diverse subjects is needed."

Twenty adults (10 men and 10 women mean+/-SD age=23.4+/-3.6 years) performed incremental cycle ergometry tests to exhaustion. Two sets of bipolar surface EMG electrodes were placed approximately parallel and perpendicular to the muscle fibers over the VL. Paired t-tests indicated that absolute EMG amplitude values for the parallel electrode orientation were greater (p<0.05) at 50, 75, and 100W. The normalized EMG amplitude also had greater values for the parallel electrode orientation at 75 and 100W. For absolute EMG MPF, the parallel electrode orientation had greater values for all six power outputs, but after normalization, the perpendicular electrode orientation had a greater value at 75W. Ten percent of the subjects exhibited different power output related patterns of responses between electrode orientations for EMG amplitude and 35% exhibited different patterns for MPF. These findings indicated that normalization reduced, but did not eliminate the influence of electrode orientation and highlighted the importance of standardizing electrode orientation to compare EMG values during cycle ergometry."

The purpose of this study was to identify the protocol eliciting the greatest improvement in power after an acute bout of WBV. Forty men and women participated in this study, in which 8 different combinations of 30, 35, 40, and 50 Hz with 2-mm and 5-mm displacements were tested over 3 days. For all protocols, randomized to reduce potential order effects, subjects underwent 30 seconds of WBV while holding an isometric squat at a knee angle of 2.27 rad. Power was assessed by countermovement jumps. Subjects performed 3 jumps before WBV, immediately afterward, and 1, 5, and 10 minutes later. The highest normalized peak power (nPP) at each time point was determined using a 4 (frequency) x 2 (displacement) x 5 (time) repeated-measures analysis of variance. Significant effects were seen for frequency (p < or = 0.026) and time (p < or = .0001). Post hoc analyses revealed that the 30-Hz condition (1.010 +/- 0.003) produced a higher nPP than 35 Hz (1.00 +/- 0.003, p < or = 0.026) and 40 Hz (1.002 +/- 0.002, p < or = 0.028) but not 50 Hz (1.004 +/- .002). We also found a significantly higher nPP for the 1-minute post-treatment time point (1.011 +/- .0003) vs. all other time points (p < or = 0.006). Our data show that an acute WBV bout can significantly increase power output at 1 minute post-treatment across all frequencies and displacements, although 30 Hz appears to have a greater effect on power output than either 35 Hz or 40 Hz, but not 50 Hz, at all post-treatment time points."

Training consisted of three sets of six to 10 repetitions at 70-90% of one repetition maximum, three times per week, on an incline squat machine for 16 weeks. Blood pressure and cardiovascular function were assessed during submaximum cycle exercise at 40 W, and 50 and 70% of maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max) before training and after 16 weeks of training. Leg strength and VO2max were assessed every 4 weeks of the 16-week study.\nRESULTS: At 40 W, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and rate pressure product were lower and stroke volume was significantly higher after 16 weeks of training. At 50% VO2max, heart rate and rate pressure product were lower after 16 weeks of training and at 70% VO2max, cycle ergometry power, VO2, and arterio-venous oxygen difference were higher after 16 weeks of training. Leg strength significantly increased after 16 weeks of training.\nCONCLUSION: Sixteen weeks of RT significantly reduces the blood pressure response and improves the cardiovascular function of older men during submaximum aerobic exercise. Therefore, RT not only increases muscular strength and hypertrophy but also provides significant cardiovascular benefits for older individuals."

This study examined how a sudden increase in exercise-induced energy expenditure affected whole body protein metabolism and nitrogen balance in people of differing levels of aerobic fitness. We hypothesized that alterations in whole-body protein turnover would be attenuated, and nitrogen balance would be preserved, in individual with higher levels of aerobic fitness.\nMETHODS: Eleven men, categorized as either having a lower (LOW-FIT; n = 5) or higher (FIT; n = 6) aerobic fitness level, completed a 4-d baseline period (BL) of an energy balance diet while maintaining usual physical activity level, followed by a 7-d intervention consisting of 1,000 kcal\u00b7d\u207b\u00b9 increased energy expenditure via exercise (50-65% VO\u2082peak). All volunteers consumed 0.9 g protein.kg\u207b\u00b9\u00b7d\u207b\u00b9 and total energy intake was adjusted to maintain energy balance throughout the 11-d study. Mean nitrogen balance (NBAL) was determined for BL, days 5-8 (EX1), and days 9-11 (EX2). Whole-body protein turnover was derived from phenylalanine and tyrosine kinetics assessed while fasting at rest on days 4, 7, and 12 using a priming dose of L-[ring-\u00b9\u2075N]tyrosine and a 4-h primed, continuous infusion of L-[\u00b9\u2075N]phenylalanine and L-[ring-\u00b2H\u2084]tyrosine.\nRESULTS: A significant main effect of time indicated that NBAL increased over the course of the intervention; however, a group-by-time interaction was not observed. Although FIT demonstrated a lower net protein oxidation and higher net protein balance compared to LOW-FIT, neither the effect of time nor a group-by-time interaction was significant for Phe flux, net protein oxidation, or derived whole-body protein synthesis and net protein balance.\nCONCLUSION: The absence of significant group-by-time interactions in protein metabolism (i.e., NBAL and whole-body protein turnover) between LOW-FIT and FIT males suggest that aerobic fitness level does not modulate protein \"sparing\" in response to an unaccustomed increase in energy expenditure."

Twenty-one well-trained men cyclists (age, 32 +/- 6 years; peak power output, 371 +/- 46 W) were randomly assigned to a power-based (GPOWER) or heart rate-based (GHEART) high-intensity training (HIT) group or a control group (GCONTROL). Training consisted of 8 repetitions of 4 minutes at either 80% of peak power output (GPOWER) or at the heart rate coinciding with 80% of peak power output (GHEART), with rest periods of 90 seconds. A 40-km time trial and VO2max test were performed before and after 8 training sessions. There were significant improvements (p < 0.05) in peak power output (GPOWER = 3.5%; GHEART = 5.0%) and 40-km time trial performance (GPOWER = 2.3%; GHEART = 2.1%) for both of the high-intensity groups. Although there were no significant differences between groups for these variables, when the data were analyzed using magnitude-based effects, the GHEART group showed greater probability of a \"beneficial\" effect for peak power output. The current general perception that prescribing training based only on power is more effective than prescribing training based on heart rate was not supported by the data from this study. Coaches who are unable to monitor progress frequently should prescribe training based on heart rate, when intervals are performed under stable conditions, because this may provide an additional advantage over prescribing training using power."

However, interactions among BMI, CRF, and mortality in older persons have not been adequately explored.\nMETHODS: Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated for predetermined strata of BMI and CRF. Independent and joint associations of CRF, BMI, and all-cause mortality were assessed by Cox proportional hazards analyses in a prospective cohort of 981 healthy men aged at least 65 years (mean age [+/-SD], 71 [+/-5] years; range, 65-88 years) referred for exercise testing during 1987-2003.\nRESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 6.9 +/- 4.4 years, a total of 208 patients died. Multivariate relative risks (95% confidence interval [CI]) of mortality across BMI groups of <20.0, 20.0-25.0, 25.0-29.9, 30.0-34.9, and > or =35.0 were 2.51 (1.26-4.98), 1.0 (reference), 0.66 (0.48-0.90), 0.50 (0.31-0.78), and 0.44 (0.20-0.97), respectively, and across CRF groups of <5.0, 5.0-8.0, and >8.0 metabolic equivalents were 1.0 (reference), 0.56 (0.40-0.78), and 0.39 (0.26-0.58), respectively. In a separate analysis of within-strata CRF according to BMI grouping, the lowest mortality risk was observed in obese men with high fitness (HR [95% CI] 0.26 [0.10-0.69]; p = .007).\nCONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of elderly male veterans, we observed independent and joint inverse relations of BMI and CRF to mortality.

We performed a retrospective survey to evaluate changing lifestyle habits after CABG during 1990-2003, focusing on the correlation between lifestyle habits and freedom from symptoms and regained exercise tolerances.\nMETHODS: We reviewed data from 2269 patients who had undergone CABG in the year 1990, 1993, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2002, or 2003. Data were collected with a questionnaire that addressed lifestyle modifications and their outcomes with regard to quality of life for up to 5 years after surgery.\nRESULTS: We observed significant decreases in changing dietary habits after surgery in patients who had surgery in 2000-2003 compared with patients who had surgery in 1990-1998 (15.9% +/- 1.6% vs 24.7% +/- 2.6%; P < .001). In addition, the desire for nutritional counselling decreased steadily over time (35.1% +/- 7.9% vs 26.6% +/- 1.4%; P <.0001). Notably, among patients 50-59 years old, fewer men than women followed a strict diet (males 20.0% vs females 41.5%; P = .001). Patients suffering from recurrent angina consulted nutritionists more often than patients without angina (36.6% vs 29.8%; P = .016). The more the patients were restricted in terms of physical fitness, as determined by the New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, the more likely they were to adhere to a healthy diet (NYHA III 22.2% vs NYHA II 14.6% vs NYHA I 10.2%; P <.001). Among patients 60-79 years old, men exercised more often than women (72.4% +/- 2.4% vs 51.1% +/- 4.9%; P <.001) and suffered less frequently from recurrent angina (13.4% +/- 4.0% vs 28.8% +/- 10.8%; P = .002).\nCONCLUSIONS: Despite knowledge of hypercholesterolemia or obesity as agents contributing to advancing coronary heart disease, attention to nutrition tends to significantly decrease over time in patients who have undergone CABG. Thus patients who have undergone CABG, especially male patients older than 50, years would benefit from dietary education. Similarly, female patients older than 60 years would benefit from increased physical activity. Patients obviously tend to delay lifestyle modification until symptoms occur.

        "abstract_content": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the physiological impact and health risks for walkers during the Nijmegen (the Netherlands) Four Days Marches in 2007, the largest walking event in the world with more than 45,000 participants.\nDESIGN: Observational study.\nMETHODS: 66 volunteers were randomly selected and counterbalanced for distance walked and gender in this observational study. Subjects walked 30 km (n = 20; 10 men), 40 km (n = 25; 14 men) or 50 km (n = 21; 10 men) per day, for 4 consecutive days. Core body temperature, fluid intake, changes in body weight, plasma sodium concentrations and energy usage were measured before and after the marches.\nRESULTS: During this event, ambient temperatures ranged from 11.0 degrees C to a maximum 25.4 degrees C expressed as 'wet bulb globe temperature' (WBGT). Heart rate (+38 beats per minute) and core body temperature (+0.8 degree C) significantly increased in all subjects during each day (about 9 hours walking per day at an average of 4.6 km/h), but hyperthermia was not diagnosed (definition: > 39.0 degrees C). Average fluid intake varied between 2.6 and 3.3 l/d with a range of 0.3-12 l/d. The relative change in body weight associated with this was -3.1 to +4.3%. Mean plasma sodium concentration decreased from 142.4 to 140.6 mmol/l over each walking day. The plasma sodium correlated negatively with fluid intake (r = -0.32; p < o.001), change in body weight (r = -0.13; p < 0.05), and walking time (r = -0.37; p < 0.001). A high prevalence of hyponatraemia (5%) and hypernatraemia (16%) was observed; extrapolating these findings to the entire field a large group (about 10,000) would have been at risk with this electrolyte imbalance.\nCONCLUSION: This study showed that walking the Four Days Marches in Nijmegen with mild ambient conditions led to one in five participants incurring disturbances in fluid and electrolyte balance. Nonetheless, the participants were well able to keep their increasing core temperature within safe limits. Apart from the frequent electrolyte imbalance, the fluid intake varied strongly between individuals."

        "year": 2008,
        "abstract_content": "Regular and vigorous physical exercise has been scientifically established as providing strong preventative medicine against cancer with the potential to reduce incidence by 40%. The effect is strongest for breast and colorectal cancer; however, evidence is accumulating for the protective influence on prostate cancer, although predominantly for more advanced disease and in older men. Following cancer diagnosis, exercise prescription can have very positive benefits for improving surgical outcomes, reducing symptom experience, managing side effects of radiation and chemotherapy, improving psychological health, maintaining physical function, and reducing fat gain and muscle and bone loss. There is now irrefutable evidence from large prospective studies that regular exercise postdiagnosis will actually increase survivorship by 50%-60% with the strongest evidence currently for breast and colorectal cancers. In our work with prostate cancer patients, we have found that exercise can limit or even reverse some of the androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) adverse effects by increasing muscle mass, functional performance, and cardiorespiratory fitness without elevating testosterone levels. Hormone therapies for breast and prostate cancer can result in alarmingly increased risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, and sarcopenia. Increasingly, patients are questioning the benefit of some cancer treatments as the risk of morbidity and mortality from other chronic diseases begins to outweigh the initial cancer diagnosis. Over three decades of research in exercise science and many hundreds of RCTs demonstrate the efficacy of appropriate physical activity for preventing and managing these secondary diseases. Based on this evidence it is now clear to us that exercise is a critical adjuvant therapy in the management of many cancers and will greatly enhance the therapeutic effects of traditional radiation and pharmaceutical treatments by increasing tolerance, reducing side effects, and lowering risk of chronic diseases, even those not aggravated by cancer treatment. While patients and their clinicians deal with their cancer, other chronic disease mechanisms continue unabated. Anxiety, depression, poor nutritional choices, and a counterproductive rest strategy will accelerate these processes, while a well-designed exercise program adhered to by the patient and supported by the medical and exercise professionals will effectively control and even reverse these diseases and disabilities. In the wide range of cancer populations that we work with, both young and old and with curative and palliative intent, our overwhelming experience is that exercise is first well tolerated, and benefits the patientpsychologically and physically. While some of our patients are on individual, home-based programs, we find that small group exercise sessions with close supervision by Exercise Physiologists (EP) provides a more motivating setting and the social interaction is critical for adherence and retention as well as greater psychological benefits such as reduced anxiety and depression and enhanced social connectedness. While managing many hundreds of cancer patients over the last 6 years, our clinic has not experienced any instances of the exercise hindering patient recovery or treatment purpose, nor have any significant injuries occurred. However, it is critical that the exercise prescription and management be tailored to the individual patient and that they are monitored by appropriately trained and professionally accredited exercise specialists. For those patients at low exercise risk and without significant musculoskeletal issues, community-based physical activity is of excellent benefit where the emphasis should be on adherence, affordability, convenience, and enjoyment."

Age adjusted death rates per 10,000 person years across incremental thirds of muscular strength were 38.9, 25.9, and 26.6 for all causes; 12.1, 7.6, and 6.6 for cardiovascular disease; and 6.1, 4.9, and 4.2 for cancer (all P<0.01 for linear trend). After adjusting for age, physical activity, smoking, alcohol intake, body mass index, baseline medical conditions, and family history of cardiovascular disease, hazard ratios across incremental thirds of muscular strength for all cause mortality were 1.0 (referent), 0.72 (95% confidence interval 0.58 to 0.90), and 0.77 (0.62 to 0.96); for death from cardiovascular disease were 1.0 (referent), 0.74 (0.50 to 1.10), and 0.71 (0.47 to 1.07); and for death from cancer were 1.0 (referent), 0.72 (0.51 to 1.00), and 0.68 (0.48 to 0.97). The pattern of the association between muscular strength and death from all causes and cancer persisted after further adjustment for cardiorespiratory fitness; however, the association between muscular strength and death from cardiovascular disease was attenuated after further adjustment for cardiorespiratory fitness.\nCONCLUSION: Muscular strength is inversely and independently associated with death from all causes and cancer in men, even after adjusting for cardiorespiratory fitness and other potential confounders."

        "abstract_content": "Various physical demands are placed on soldiers, whose effectiveness and survivability depend on their combat-specific physical fitness. Because sport training programs involving weight-based training have proven effective, this study examined the value of such a program for short-term military training using combat-relevant tests. A male weight-based training (WBT) group (n = 15; mean +/- SD: 27.0 +/- 4.7 years, 173.8 +/- 5.8 cm, 80.9 +/- 12.7 kg) performed full-body weight-based training workouts, 3.2-km runs, interval training, agility training, and progressively loaded 8-km backpack hikes. A male Army Standardized Physical Training (SPT) group (n = 17; mean +/- SD: 29.0 +/- 4.6 years, 179.7 +/- 8.2 cm, 84.5 +/- 10.4 kg) followed the new Army Standardized Physical Training program of stretching, varied calisthenics, movement drills, sprint intervals, shuttle running, and distance runs. Both groups exercised for 1.5 hours a day, 5 days a week for 8 weeks. The following training-induced changes were statistically significant (P < 0.05) for both training groups: 3.2-km run or walk with 32-kg load (minutes), 24.5 +/- 3.2 to 21.0 +/- 2.8 (SPT) and 24.9 +/- 2.8 to 21.1 +/- 2.2 (WBT); 400-m run with 18-kg load (seconds), 94.5 +/- 14.2 to 84.4 +/- 11.9 (SPT) and 100.1 +/- 16.1 to 84.0 +/- 8.4 (WBT); obstacle course with 18-kg load (seconds), 73.3 +/- 10.1 to 61.6 +/- 7.7 (SPT) and 66.8 +/- 10.0 to 60.1 +/- 8.7 (WBT); 5 30-m sprints to prone (seconds), 63.5 +/- 4.8 to 59.8 +/- 4.1 (SPT) and 60.4 +/- 4.2 to 58.9 +/- 2.7 (WBT); and 80-kg casualty rescue from 50 m (seconds), 65.8 +/- 40.0 to 42.1 +/- 9.9 (SPT) and 57.6 +/- 22.0 to 44.2 +/- 8.8 (WBT). Of these tests, only the obstacle course showed significant difference in improvement between the two training groups. Thus, for short-term (i.e., 8-week) training of relatively untrained men, the Army's new Standardized Physical Training program and a weight-based training experimental program can produce similar, significant, and meaningful improvements in military physical performance. Further research would be needed to determine whether weight-based training provides an advantage over a longer training period."

        "abstract_content": "BACKGROUND: older adults can be limited in their performance of daily tasks due to an inadequate aerobic capacity. Aerobic capacity below minimum physiological thresholds required to maintain independence leaves older adults with little, or no, aerobic reserve.\nOBJECTIVE: the aim of this study was to measure functional performance and aerobic reserve in older adults during the serial performance of daily tasks.\nSUBJECTS: twenty-nine (n = 29) men and women (n = 23 females) 70-92 years of age participated in this study.\nMETHODS: performance based physical function was assessed using the Continuous-Scale Physical Functional Performance test (CS-PFP). A Cosmed K4b(2) portable metabolic system was used to measure VO(2PEAK) and oxygen uptake during the serial performance of a battery of daily tasks (VO(2PFP)). Aerobic reserve was calculated as the difference between VO(2PEAK) and VO(2PFP).\nRESULTS: the correlation coefficient between aerobic reserve and functional performance was r = 0.50(P = 0.006). Participants utilized 32.2 +/- 8.1%, 42.7 +/- 10.8%, and 50.3 +/- 12.3% of VO(2PEAK) for the low, moderate, and high workloads of the CS-PFP, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: light housework and carrying groceries require 40 to 50% of peak oxygen consumption. This information can be used by clinicians and health professionals working with older adults as a guide to how much aerobic fitness is needed to perform ADLs and maintain independence. These can then be used as guides for assessment and for setting training goals in older adults."

Models for predicted or impaired EC were identified by literature search. Gender-specific multivariable proportional hazards models were constructed. Four methods were used to assess validity: Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), right-censored c-index in 100 out-of-bootstrap samples, the Nagelkerke Index R2, and calculation of calibration error in 100 bootstrap samples.\nRESULTS: There were 646 and 430 deaths in 13,098 men and 9,177 women, respectively. Of the 7 models tested in men, a model based on a Veterans Affairs cohort (predicted metabolic equivalents [METs] = 18 - [0.15 x age]) had the highest AIC and R2. In women, a model based on the St. James Take Heart Project (predicted METs = 14.7 - [0.13 x age]) performed best. Categorical definitions of fitness performed less well. Even after accounting for age and gender, there was still an important interaction with age, whereby predicted EC was a weaker predictor in older subjects (p for interaction <0.001 in men and 0.003 in women).\nCONCLUSIONS: Several methods describe EC accounting for age and gender-related differences, but their ability to predict mortality differ. Simple cutoff values fail to fully describe EC's strong predictive value."

        "year": 2002,
        "abstract_content": "UNLABELLED: The aim of the study was to answer the following questions: What factors determine that disabled people take up systematic sport activity or should make such a decision? What reasons are able to eliminate the handicapped from process of regular going in for sport? Three groups of men participated. The group of disabled sportsmen included 39 subjects, the group of non-active disabled people 36 subjects and the group of able-bodied students 45 subjects. All the involved people answered the questions of the questionnaire, which concerned factors associated with sport activity of the handicapped and their socio-demographic characteristics, among other things. The opportunity of improvement of the health status is the main advantage of the sport for disabled people (53%). The chance of self-testing and sport competition was pointed out by 47% of subjects. The most common reason for taking up sport activity was sport passion (over 50%). The others were: possibility of creating new contacts with people, improvement of the physical condition, chance of self-testing and passing free time (23%). The lack of free time was the factor eliminating from sport activity in the second group (28%). The other problem was the shortage of appropriate clubs, equipment, infrastructure etc. (almost 25%). Students concluded that sport for disabled people aims to improve the mental condition mainly (42%). Quite similar percentage of the group (38%) didn't see any reason that was able to exclude the handicapped from goingin for sport.\nCONCLUSIONS: (1) Not only does active going in for sport improve the physical condition of the handicapped but strengthen them psychically as well. (2) The lack of sport activity in disabled people is to a high degree a result of low number of sport clubs, organisations, buildings as well as presence of architectural barriers."

        "abstract_content": "The purpose of this investigation was to determine if energy intake compensation is more accurate in males compared to females matched for age, habitual physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness, and dietary cognitive restraint. Healthy, nonobese young men (n=12) and women (n=12) were provided with an ad libitum lunch meal on two occasions. Thirty minutes prior to the lunch meals, subjects were given either a yogurt preload (YP; 500 mL, 1988 kJ, men; 375 mL, 1507 kJ, women) or no preload (NP). Energy intake at the two lunch meals was measured. Visual analog scales were used to assess changes in hunger and fullness. Blood glucose concentrations were also determined. Energy intake compensation for the YP was significantly more accurate in the male compared to the female subjects (86.2+/-5.0 vs. 73.6+/-4.8% compensation). There were no sex differences in perceptions of hunger and satiety. In the pooled sample, hunger ratings were significantly higher in the NP condition, but there were no significant differences in fullness ratings between test meals. In the YP condition, glycemic response to the preload and the ad libitum meal was significantly higher in males compared to females. These results suggest that under acute test meal conditions, energy intake regulation is more accurate in males. Relative inability to regulate energy intake may predispose females to gain weight over time."

Aging induces progressive impairment of glomeruli leading to an increase in protein excretion. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of maximal exercise on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albumin excretion in an aging population.\nMETHODS: This is a cross-sectional study from 213 healthy men, sedentary or endurance-trained, aged 20-30 and 50-80 years submitted to maximal exercise on a cycle ergometer. Blood and urine samples were obtained at rest and after the strenuous exercise. We evaluated the GFR by measuring creatinine clearance and the urine albumin excretion rate.\nRESULTS: After exercise, the older adults had a lesser reduction in GFR (mean 12%) than the young participants (mean 28%). As compared to those at rest, the increase of postexercise albumin excretion rates was lower in older participants (mean 7-fold) versus the young population (mean 20-fold). It appears that the exercise impact on some renal functions is related to the absolute load imposed on the individuals (r2 = 0.693).\nCONCLUSION: As far as GFR and urine albumin excretion are concerned, regular endurance training does not induce any signs of potential incipient nephropathy in a healthy aging population."

Body fat (16.9 +/- 5.3% for men versus 21.1 +/- 5.3% for women, P<0.05), blood lipids, blood glucose and systolic and diastolic BP all changed negatively over the study duration. These changes occurred similarly in both genders and irrespective of menstrual and hormone replacement status among the women. Lastly, the changes in CHD risk factors were not predicted by change in exercise or nutritional patterns.\nCONCLUSIONS: despite the maintenance of significant volumes of exercise and the absence of changes in diet, most CHD risk factors demonstrated unfavourable changes over 10 years in chronic men and women runners. However, the absolute values for most CHD risk factors remained better than those reported for sedentary peers of comparable age."

        "abstract_content": "The purpose of the present investigation was to compare the content of 8 weeks of training in young endurance-trained male and female runners and study the potential impact of this training content on performance. Fourteen men and 11 women performed two criterion exercises until exhaustion on an outdoor track before and after the 8-week training period. The first test was a graded exercise to determine maximal aerobic velocity (Mav), the velocity at the lactate concentration threshold (v-Tlac), and the velocity at delta 50 (v delta50: the velocity halfway between Mav and v-Tlac). The second test was a constant run at v delta50 to determine the time to exhaustion at this velocity (tlimv delta50). Training logs were used to monitor the self-directed training sessions. The results showed that the women had a lower training volume but trained at higher exercise velocities than the men. However they presented similar values as the men for expected temporary performance capacity and did not improve their performance (Mav and tlimv delta50) over the 8-week period. After the training period, only v-Tlac (absolute and relative values) was slightly but significantly increased by training. These results could be due to the fact that both men and women did not train more than 10% of the total distance run at exercise velocities equal to or higher than their Mav and did not increase their training load during the 8-week training period. We suggest that changes in training content during the season, such as severe (long-duration or high-intensity) training sessions, may have improved their performance capacity."

Less is known about the association between respiratory symptoms and mortality and whether such an association is independent of physical fitness. In this study, we assessed the association of breathlessness and productive cough with CV and all-cause mortality over 26 years.\nDESIGN: Prospective occupational cohort study.\nSETTING AND SUBJECTS: In 1972-75, 1999 apparently healthy men aged 40-59 years were recruited to the study from five companies in Oslo, Norway. At study entry clinical, physiological and biochemical parameters including respiratory symptoms, spirometry, and an objective assessment of physical fitness were measured in all subjects, of whom 1,623 had acceptable spirometry. The data was analysed using Cox proportional hazards analysis, adjusting for age, lung function, physical fitness, and other possible confounders, with mortality until 2000.\nRESULTS: After 26 years (range 25-27), 615 men (38%) had died, of whom 308 (50%) from CV deaths. In multivariable proportional hazards models, 'having phlegm winter mornings' [hazard ratio (HR) 1.30, P = 0.01], 'breathlessness when hurrying/walking uphill' (HR 1.43, P = 0.005) and combinations of the two symptoms remained significant predictors of all-cause mortality. None of six respiratory symptoms were significant predictors of CV mortality in multivariable models.\nCONCLUSIONS: Phlegm, breathlessness and combinations of them were associated with all-cause mortality, even after adjusting for physical fitness, known CV and other risk factors such as smoking, and lung function. The finding of an association also after adjustment for physical fitness is new. In contrast, none of the six respiratory symptoms individually or in combination were associated with CV mortality in multivariable analysis."

Cross-validation by the PRESS technique confirmed these statistics. Accuracy of the models for predicting VO2max of subsamples was supported by constant errors (CE) < 1 mL.kg.min for subgroups of gender, age, PASS, and VO2max between 30 and 50 mL x kg(-1) x min(-1) (70% of the sample). CE were > 1 mL x kg(-1) x min(-1) for VO2max < 30 and > 50 mL x kg(-1) x min(-1).\nCONCLUSIONS: Waist girth is an acceptable surrogate for body composition in the nonexercise models. All models were similar in accuracy and valid for estimating VO2max of most adults, but with reduced accuracy at the extremes of fitness (VO2max < 30 and >50 mL x kg(-1) x min(-1))."

        "abstract_content": "In view of the growing health problem associated with obesity, clarification of the regulation of energy homeostasis is important. Peripheral signals, such as ghrelin and leptin, have been shown to influence energy homeostasis. Nutrients and physical exercise, in turn, influence hormone levels. Data on the hormonal response to physical exercise (standardized negative energy balance) after high-fat (HF) or low-fat (LF) diet with identical carbohydrate intake are currently not available. The aim of the study was to investigate whether a short-term dietary intervention with HF and LF affects ghrelin and leptin levels and their modulators, GH, insulin and cortisol, before and during aerobic exercise. Eleven healthy, endurance-trained male athletes (W(max) 365 +/- 29 W) were investigated twice in a randomized crossover design following two types of diet: 1. LF - 0.5 g fat/kg body weight (BW) per day for 2.5 days; 2. HF - 0.5 g fat/kg BW per day for 1 day followed by 3.5 g fat/kg BW per day for 1.5 days. After a standardized carbohydrate snack in the morning, metabolites and hormones (GH, ghrelin, leptin, insulin and cortisol) were measured before and at regular intervals throughout a 3-h aerobic exercise test on a cycloergometer at 50% of W(max). Diet did not significantly affect GH and cortisol concentrations during exercise but resulted in a significant increase in ghrelin and decrease in leptin concentrations after LF compared with HF diet (area under the curve (AUC) ghrelin LF vs HF: P < 0.03; AUC leptin LF vs HF: P < 0.02, Wilcoxon rank test). These data suggest that acute negative energy balance induced by exercise elicits a hormonal response with opposite changes of ghrelin and leptin. In addition, the hormonal response is modulated by the preceding intake of fat."

Understanding the contribution of physical fitness components to functional performance facilitates the development of adequate exercise interventions aiming at preservation of function and independence of older people. The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between physical fitness components and functional performance in older people living in long-term care facilities.\nMETHODS: Design cross-sectional study. Subjects 226 persons living in long-term care facilities (mean age: 81.6 +/- 5.6). Outcome measures Physical fitness and functional performance were measured by performance-based tests.\nRESULTS: Knee and elbow extension strength were significantly higher in men (difference = 44.5 and 50.0 N, respectively), whereas women were more flexible (difference sit & reach test = 7.2 cm). Functional performance was not significantly different between the genders. In men, motor coordination (eye-hand coordination) and measures of strength were the main contributors to functional performance, whereas in women flexibility (sit and reach test) and motor coordination (tandem stance and eye-hand coordination) played a major role.\nCONCLUSION: The results of this study show that besides muscle strength, fitness components such as coordination and flexibility are associated with functional performance of older people living in long-term care facilities. This suggests that men and women living in long-term care facilities, differ considerably concerning the fitness factors contributing to functional performance. Women and men may, therefore, need exercise programs emphasizing different fitness aspects in order to improve functional performance."

        "abstract_content": "OBJECTIVES: To determine ambulatory activity in a sample of community-dwelling people with chronic hemiparetic stroke and to examine whether deficits in balance and gait and cardiovascular and metabolic fitness are key determinants of ambulatory activity levels.\nDESIGN: Descriptive correlational.\nSETTING: Home and community.\nPARTICIPANTS: Twenty-eight men and 22 women (N=50) over the age 45 years with more than 6 months of hemiparetic gait after ischemic stroke.\nINTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Ambulatory activity (total daily step activity), mobility deficit severity (Berg Balance Scale [BBS] scores, timed 10-m walks), and cardiovascular fitness (energy costs of hemiparetic gait, peak exercise capacity [VO2peak]).\nRESULTS: Mean ambulatory activity profiles were extremely low (2837 steps/d vs reported 5000-6000 steps/d in sedentary older adults). Ambulatory activity levels were strongly associated with BBS scores (r=.581, P<.001) and self-selected floor walking velocity (r=.554, P<.001). Participants also had profound cardiovascular deconditioning (mean VO2peak, 11.7+/-2.8 mL.kg(-1).min(-1)). The energy costs of hemiparetic gait were high (8.7+/-1.7 mL.kg(-1).min(-1)), representing 76% of physiologic fitness reserve. Although the relationships of economy of gait and VO2peak to ambulatory activity was not statistically significant, both the VO2peak and the physiologic fitness reserve, as expressed by fractional utilization, were strongly related to balance (r=.374, P=.02; r=-.430, P< .01, respectively.) The BBS predicted 30% of the variance in ambulatory activity.\nCONCLUSIONS: Ambulatory activity levels and cardiovascular fitness in patients with chronic stroke are extremely low. Mobility deficits, particularly in balance, are associated with low ambulatory activity. Balance-related inactivity may be an important factor in deconditioning. Further studies are needed to better understand whether task-oriented exercise enhances balance and whether increases in daily ambulatory activity yield improved cardiovascular fitness in chronic stroke survivors."

A totla of 123 subjects completed AT (51 men, 72 women) and 83 subjects completed ST (40 men, 43 women). DNA was extracted from blood samples of all subjects and genotyping was performed at the VDR FokI and BsmI locus to determine its association to training response. Total body, greater trochanter and femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD) were measured before and after both training programmes using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. VDR BsmI genotype was not significantly related to BMD at baseline or after ST or AT. However, VDR FokI genotype was significantly related to ST- but not AT-induced changes in femoral neck BMD (P < 0.05). The heterozygotes (Ff) in the ST group approached a significantly greater increase in femoral neck BMD (P = 0.058) compared to f homozygotes. There were no significant genotype relationships in the AT group. These data indicate that VDR FokI genotype may influence femoral neck BMD response to ST, but not AT."

LH decreased after the 1( st) race by 37% and after the 2nd race by 44% (p=0.028, both). FSH secretion was stable and cortisol increased 2.2- and 2.6-fold after the races (p<0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: The participants in the 2 days' prolonged skiing exercise went through a period of heavy physical stress. They showed changes in their serum testosterone, LH and cortisol concentrations, which, with the exception of the FSH secretion, alter the acute responses of both the adrenal cortex and the hypothalamus-pituitary-testicular axis. When training or competition programmes are planned it should taken into consideration that daily repeated high intensity prolonged skiing without a recovery day may cause hormonal overreaching."

Muscle fiber type and contractile function are primarily determined by myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms. There are few data available on the effects of aging on MHC isoform expression in humans. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that MHC isoform protein composition and mRNA abundance would favor a fast-to-slow isoform shift with aging and in response to endurance exercise training. Muscle biopsies were obtained from previously sedentary, healthy men and women, aged 21-87 yr before (n = 77) and after (n = 65) 16 wk of bicycle training (up to 45 min at 80% peak heart rate, 3-4 days/wk). At baseline, MHC I mRNA was unchanged with age, whereas IIa and IIx declined by 14 and 10% per decade, respectively (P < 0.001). MHC IIa and IIx protein declined by 3 and 1% per decade with a reciprocal increase in MHC I (P < 0.05). After training, MHC I and IIa mRNA increased by 61 and 99%, respectively, and IIx decreased by 50% (all P < 0.001). The increase in MHC I mRNA was positively associated with age, whereas the changes in MHC IIa and IIx mRNA were similar across age. MHC I protein increased by 6% and was positively related to age, whereas IIx decreased by 5% and was inversely related to age. These results suggest that the altered expression of MHC isoforms with aging is transcriptionally regulated. In response to endurance exercise, regulation of MHC isoform transcripts remains robust in older muscle, but this did not result in corresponding changes in MHC protein expression."

Testing included assessment of exercise capacity (peak VO2), quadriceps muscle strength, body composition, physical activity participation, and self-reported functioning (SF-36). Repeated measures of analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc contrasts was performed to determine differences over time and a second ANOVA assessed differences over time between genders. All patients increased peak VO2, quadriceps muscle strength, and percent body fat (p < 0.0001) from 2 to 24 months. Men and women differed in their changes of peak VO2 and percent body fat (p < 0.05). At 24 months, only 50% of the patients reported participating in regular physical activity. All SF-36 physical measures except general health, improved from 2 to 24 months (p < 0.0001). Measures of health-related fitness and QoL improve over the first 2 yr post-OLT with the greatest gains occurring in the first 6 months and all measures remain lower than recommended for cardiovascular and overall health. A randomized clinical trial of lifestyle modifications such as diet and exercise intervention is warranted to determine the impact of such modifications on HRQoL and fitness post-OLT."

The initial HR transient was represented by the cardiac vagal index (CVI), which was obtained by the 4sET, and the final transient (ie, HR recovery [HRR]) was determined by the following equation: CPET maximal HR - the 1-min postexercise HR. Transients were modestly related (r = 0.22; p < 0.001) when adjusted for age, aerobic fitness, clinical status, and negative chronotropic action drug usage. The transients were unrelated to gender (vs CVI, p = 0.10; vs HRR, p = 0.15). Subjects with a measured maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) exceeding 100% of the predicted maximal aerobic power showed higher CVIs than those in less aerobically fit subjects (VO2max < 50% subgroup, p = 0.009; VO2max < 75% subgroup, p = 0.034). Both transient results differed for asymptomatic and cardiac subjects (CVI, 1.32 +/- 0.02 vs 1.42 +/- 0.02, respectively [p = 0.001]; HRR, 33 +/- 1 beats/min (bpm) vs 37 +/- 1 bpm, respectively [p = 0.009]).\nCONCLUSIONS: The initial and final HR transients were modestly related, suggesting a potentially complementary clinical role for both measurements in the assessment of autonomic function in patients with coronary artery disease. Although both HR transients tended to behave similarly under the influence of several variables, the initial HR transient, measured during 4sET, was more likely to discriminate distinct subgroups compared with the final HR transient."

It was hypothesised that exercise intensity is of primary importance to the regulation of fat oxidation and that gender, body composition, physical activity level, and training status are secondary and can explain part of the observed interindividual variation. For this purpose, 300 healthy men and women (157 men and 143 women) performed an incremental exercise test to exhaustion on a treadmill [adapted from a previous protocol (Achten J, Venables MC, and Jeukendrup AE. Metabolism 52: 747-752, 2003)]. Substrate oxidation was determined using indirect calorimetry. For each individual, maximal fat oxidation (MFO) and the intensity at which MFO occurred (Fat(max)) were determined. On average, MFO was 7.8 +/- 0.13 mg.kg fat-free mass (FFM)(-1).min(-1) and occurred at 48.3 +/- 0.9% maximal oxygen uptake (Vo(2 max)), equivalent to 61.5 +/- 0.6% maximal heart rate. MFO (7.4 +/- 0.2 vs. 8.3 +/- 0.2 mg.kg.FFM(-1).min(-1); P < 0.01) and Fat(max) (45 +/- 1 vs. 52 +/- 1% Vo(2 max); P < 0.01) were significantly lower in men compared with women. When corrected for FFM, MFO was predicted by physical activity (self-reported physical activity level), Vo(2 max), and gender (R(2) = 0.12) but not with fat mass. Men compared with women had lower rates of fat oxidation and an earlier shift to using carbohydrate as the dominant fuel. Physical activity, Vo(2 max), and gender explained only 12% of the interindividual variation in MFO during exercise, whereas body fatness was not a predictor. The interindividual variation in fat oxidation remains largely unexplained."

        "abstract_content": "Moderate-intensity physical activity is recommended to promote health, and augment peak oxygen transport, thus reducing the risk of chronic disease, and delaying functional loss in the elderly. The optimal method of prescribing the recommended intensity of effort [approximately 50% of oxygen intake reserve ( V(.)O(2reserve)) or heart rate reserve (HR(reserve))] remains unclear for this age group. Our aim was to develop a new field-method of prescribing exercise for the elderly, based on walking velocity measured over a 5-m distance. Walking velocities were calculated from the time taken to move from the 3-m to the 8-m mark on an 11-m, straight, flat walkway. Interrelationships of preferred and maximal walking velocities with traditional laboratory measurements [peak isometric knee-extension strength and maximal oxygen intake ( V(.)O(2max))] were examined in 10 healthy male and 13 healthy female volunteers, aged 65-74 years. Percentages of oxygen intake reserve (% V(.)O(2reserve)) and heart rate reserve (%HR(reserve)) were also determined when walking at 30-70% of maximal velocity. Preferred and maximal walking velocities were significantly correlated ( r>0.60; P<0.05), the former corresponding to an average of 53-54% of the latter in both men and women. Maximal walking velocity was significantly correlated with both peak knee-extension torque ( r>0.90; P<0.05) and V(.)O(2max) ( r>0.80; P<0.05). As a result, the % V(.)O(2reserve) and %HR(reserve) showed a regular and linear relationship to various submaximal walking velocities. For both men and women, 40-60% of the maximal walking velocity corresponded to about 30-50% of V(.)O(2reserve) and HR(reserve). Approximately 60% of the maximal walking velocity (or 110-115% of the preferred walking velocity) represents an appropriate intensity of moderate exercise for the typical elderly person. Our preliminary data suggest that a prescription based on walking velocity over the 5-m distance allows the healthy elderly to exercise simply, safely, and effectively."

A body-shape dissatisfaction score was calculated using the difference between the participant's choice for current and ideal body shape from a nine-figure body-silhouette scale. Present study findings suggested that both older adult men and women expressed a desire for a thinner body shape independent of age and current participation in exercise.

Running times for the top 50 male and female finishers over the past two decades showed significantly greater improvement in the master groups than in the younger age groups (p<0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Participation in the New York City Marathon is increasing at a higher rate in the master groups than in other age groups. Male and female masters continued to improve running times at a greater rate than the younger athletes, whose performance levels have plateaued. This is the largest study to compare master athletic performance with younger counterparts and men with women."

        "abstract_content": "This study examined the effects of progressive exercise to fatigue in normoxia (N) on muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) cycling and whether alterations in SR Ca(2+) cycling are related to the blunted peak mechanical power output (PO(peak)) and peak oxygen consumption (Vo(2 peak)) observed during progressive exercise in hypoxia (H). Nine untrained men (20.7 +/- 0.42 yr) performed progressive cycle exercise to fatigue on two occasions, namely during N (inspired oxygen fraction = 0.21) and during H (inspired oxygen fraction = 0.14). Tissue extracted from the vastus lateralis before exercise and at power output corresponding to 50 and 70% of Vo(2 peak) (as determined during N) and at fatigue was used to investigate changes in homogenate SR Ca(2+)-cycling properties. Exercise in H compared with N resulted in a 19 and 21% lower (P < 0.05) PO(peak) and Vo(2 peak), respectively. During progressive exercise in N, Ca(2+)-ATPase kinetics, as determined by maximal activity, the Hill coefficient, and the Ca(2+) concentration at one-half maximal activity were not altered. However, reductions with exercise in N were noted in Ca(2+) uptake (before exercise = 357 +/- 29 micromol x min(-1) x g protein(-1); at fatigue = 306 +/- 26 micromol x min(-1) x g protein(-1); P < 0.05) when measured at free Ca(2+) concentration of 2 microM and in phase 2 Ca(2+) release (before exercise = 716 +/- 33 micromol x min(-1) x g protein(-1); at fatigue = 500 +/- 53 micromol x min(-1) x g protein(-1); P < 0.05) when measured in vitro in whole muscle homogenates. No differences were noted between N and H conditions at comparable power output or at fatigue. It is concluded that, although structural changes in SR Ca(2+)-cycling proteins may explain fatigue during progressive exercise in N, they cannot explain the lower PO(peak) and Vo(2 peak) observed during H."

Eight lean men were each studied four times in a 2 x 2 randomized design. EI was directly quantified by weight of food consumed. EE was assessed by heart rate (HR) monitoring. Body weight was measured daily. Mean daily EE was 17.6 and 11.5 MJ/day (P < 0.001) on the pooled Hex and Nex treatments, respectively. EI was higher on HF diets (13.4 MJ/day pooled) compared with the LF diets (9.0 MJ/day). Regression analysis showed that these energy imbalances induced significant compensatory changes in EB over time of approximately 0.3-0.4 MJ/day (P < 0.05). These were due to changes in both EI and EE in the opposite direction to the perturbation in energy balance. These changes were significant, small but persistent, amounting to approximately 0.2 and approximately 0.35 MJ/day for EI and EE, respectively."

        "authors": "Hawkins S, Wiswell R",
        "year": 2003,
        "abstract_content": "Because of the influence of cardiorespiratory fitness on functional independence, quality of life, and cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality, tremendous interest has been directed towards describing the age-related change in maximal oxygen consumption (VO(2max)). Current evidence supports a 10% per decade decline in VO(2max) in men and women regardless of activity level. High-intensity exercise may reduce this loss by up to 50% in young and middle-aged men, but not older men, if maintained long term. Middle-aged and older women do not appear to be able to reduce loss rates in VO(2max) to less than 10% per decade, which may be related to estrogen status. However, maintaining high-intensity training seems limited to approximately one decade at best and to a select few individuals. While the factors limiting the ability to maintain high-intensity training are not completely known, aging most likely plays a role as studies have demonstrated that training maintenance becomes more difficult with advancing age. Age-related loss of VO(2max) seems to occur in a non-linear fashion in association with declines in physical activity. In sedentary individuals, this non-linear decline generally occurs during the twenties and thirties whereas athletic individuals demonstrate a non-linear decline upon decreasing or ceasing training. Non-linear loss rates are also demonstrated in individuals over the age of 70 years. The decline in VO(2max) seems to be due to both central and peripheral adaptations, primarily reductions in maximal heart rate (HR(max)) and lean body mass (LBM). Exercise training does not influence declines in HR(max), while LBM can be maintained to some degree by exercise. Recommendations for exercise training should include aerobic activities utilising guidelines established by the American College of Sports Medicine for improving CV fitness and health, as well as strength training activities for enhancing LBM."

Current physical activity was assessed 12-15 times during the study via 24-h recall. Previous-year physical activity was assessed using the Baecke questionnaire at baseline.\nRESULTS: Mean BMI and hs-CRP were unchanged over the course of the study, but current physical activity increased on visit 3. Average hs-CRP was not related to average current physical activity or to natural changes in current physical activity across the five visits. Additionally, current physical activity on any given visit was not associated with hs-CRP on the following visit. When current physical activity, BMI, age, gender, and smoking were included in the statistical model, only BMI was significantly related to hs-CRP (P < 0.001). Average hs-CRP was significantly correlated with average BMI (r = 0.50; P < 0.001) but was not related to previous-year (Baecke) physical activity levels (r = 0.02; P = 0.89). When subjects were grouped by BMI (<25 kg.m-2, 25-29.9 kg x m-2, >30 kg x m-2) hs-CRP was significantly greater in obese (3.2 +/- 1.9 mg.L-1) and overweight (2.1 +/- 1.7 mg x L-1) than normal weight (1.1 +/- 1.0 mg.L-1) subjects (ANOVA P < 0.05). Current physical activity was similar between the three BMI groups at all times, and was unrelated to hs-CRP in all groups, throughout the study period.\nCONCLUSION: These data indicate that BMI, but not previous-year or current physical activity, predicts hs-CRP."

Articular cartilage volumes and bone size were determined at the patella, medial and lateral tibia by processing images acquired in the sagittal plane using T1-weighted fat saturation magnetic resonance imaging. Height, weight, physical activity (lower limb muscle strength, endurance fitness and questionnaire items) and radiographic osteoarthritis (ROA) were measured.\nRESULTS: Gender explained 33-42% of the variation in knee cartilage volumes (all P < 0.001). Males had 33-42% higher cartilage volume than females at all sites. In the whole group, the magnitude of sex differences decreased to 8-18% after adjustment for body height, weight and bone size, but remained significant (all P < 0.05). Further adjustment for physical activity had no effect on the sex differences. The sex differences in cartilage volume were greater in those aged over 50 compared with those aged under 50 (P < 0.05 for age-sex interaction at all sites) and were independent of ROA.\nCONCLUSIONS: Men have substantially higher knee cartilage volumes than women. These sex differences appear to be mediated in part by body and bone size but a significant amount remains unexplained. Furthermore, the differences become more marked over the age of 50 yr suggesting that both cartilage development and cartilage loss in later life contribute to sex differences in cartilage volume. Further longitudinal studies in large samples will be required to confirm these findings."

Main outcome measures were bioelectric impedance for body fat composition, peak oxygen consumption (VO(2)max), gait speed, handgrip strength, and chair rise time.\nRESULTS: The mean age of participants was years. Those with a higher self-reported walking level had a better VO(2)max; every 1 minute per day increase in habitual walking increases VO(2)max by 0.096 (ml/kg)/min (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.027-0.165, p=.007) and is possibly associated with a faster gait speed; (95% CI 0.000-0.005, p=.078). There is an age-related rise in body fat composition, decline in VO(2)max, and slower chair rise time. Men had a lower body fat composition, better VO(2)max, and stronger handgrip.\nCONCLUSIONS: Habitual walking may impart important health benefits in terms of improvement in physical performance, fitness, and its implications for the prevention of physical disability in older adults. This also reinforces the theory that low- to moderate-intensity activities may improve cardiorespiratory fitness. There is an inevitable physiological age-related decline in physical fitness."

J Appl Physiol 72: 484-491, 1992). We hypothesized that 5 days of STT would attenuate pyruvate production and the increase in muscle tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates (TCAI) during exercise, because of reduced flux through the reaction catalyzed by alanine aminotransferase (AAT; pyruvate + glutamate <--> 2-oxoglutarate + alanine). Eight women [22 +/- 1 yr, peak oxygen uptake (Vo2 peak) = 40.3 +/- 4.6 ml. kg-1. min-1] performed seven 45-min bouts of cycle exercise at 70% Vo2 peak over 9 days (1 bout/day; rest only on days 2 and 8). During the first and last bouts, biopsies (vastus lateralis) were obtained at rest and after 5 and 45 min of exercise. Muscle glycogen concentration was approximately 50% higher at rest after STT (493 +/- 38 vs. 330 +/- 20 mmol/kg dry wt; P <or= 0.05), and net glycogenolysis and lactate accumulation were reduced after 5 min of exercise by 59 and 49%, respectively (P <or= 0.05). The net increase in four measured TCAI was approximately 40% lower (P <or= 0.05) during exercise after training (1.68 +/- 0.60 vs. 2.71 +/- 0.44 mmol/kg dry wt), and the net decrease in glutamate concentration was attenuated (P <or= 0.05). We conclude that 1). the contraction-induced increase in flux through AAT is reduced after 5 days of aerobic training and 2). the muscle glycogenolytic response during exercise after STT in women is similar to that in men."

        "abstract_content": "INTRODUCTION/PURPOSE: Despite a large public health interest in physical activity and its role in obesity and other chronic diseases, only few reports to date have addressed total levels and trends of physical activity. We have studied in a cross-sectional setting with a retrospective recall of physical activity an association of levels of total physical activity and different types of activities with age and with calendar-time.\nMETHODS: In a population-based study of 33,466 men aged 45-79 yr in central Sweden, information on physical activity and other lifestyle factors was collected through a self-administered questionnaire. Level of total activity at ages 15, 30, and 50 yr was assessed quantitatively, based on six questions on different activities: work/occupation, housework, walking/bicycling, exercise, inactive leisure time, and sleeping. The physical activity levels were measured as metabolic equivalents, MET-hours per days.\nRESULTS: Total daily physical activity decreased at age 30 yr (-1.6%, 95% CI: -1.7, -1.4) and at age 50 yr (-3.9%, 95% CI: -4.0, -3.7) compared with age 15 yr. Total physical activity decreased over a period of 60 yr in all three separate age groups (-9.1% among 15-yr-olds, 95% CI: -9.8, -8.5; -2.3% among 30-yr-olds 95% CI: -3.0, -1.6; and -2.9% among 50-yr-olds, 95% CI: -3.4, -2.5).\nCONCLUSION: These negative trends in physical activity observed by age and with time might explain the trends in increasing prevalence of obesity."

We followed study participants from the baseline visit to the date of death or December 31, 1996, for survivors.\nRESULTS: Over an average follow-up of 13.0 +/- 6.2 yr, there were 724 deaths, 205 (28.3%) from CVD. For analyses, the men were stratified into two age groups: younger (20-39 yr) and older (40-59 yr). Cox regression analysis was used to adjust for age, resting heart rate, cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), resting systolic blood pressure (SBP), SBP difference, cholesterol, triglycerides, body mass index (BMI), smoking, and alcohol consumption. Among younger men, HRR was the only factor associated with CVD mortality (instantaneous relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval for HRR = 0.6, 0.5-0.9 for CVD mortality by 10 beats.min(-1) increment), whereas only CRF and BMI were associated with all-cause mortality. Among older men, HRR was inversely associated with CVD and all-cause mortality, as were several other known risk factors, including CRF (RR(per 2 METs), and 95% CI for HRR = 0.7, 0.5-0.9 for CVD mortality and 0.8, 0.7-0.9 for all-cause mortality). CONCLUSIONS HRR, independent from CRF, was inversely associated with CVD mortality among men in this study. HRR may be an important exercise test parameter to predict CVD mortality in younger men, whereas CRF and other established risk factors are better predictors of CVD and all-cause mortality in older men."

During one BR, subjects did not exercise (CON). During another BR, subjects exercised for 40 min.d(-1) on a supine treadmill against 50-60 mm Hg LBNP (EX). Exercise training consisted of an interval exercise protocol of 2- to 3-min intervals alternating between 41 and 65% (.)VO(2max).

During the aerobic dance and walking sessions, heart rate and .VO(2) were measured continuously throughout. Rate of perceived exertion (RPE) was measured every three minutes throughout the session.\nRESULTS: The sample means (SD) for %peak .VO(2) were 67 (17)% for the aerobic dance sessions and 52 (10)% for the walking sessions, and the %HRmax sample means (SD) were 74 (12)% for the aerobic dance sessions and 60(8)% for walking sessions. The sample mean (SD) RPE for the aerobic dance sessions was 11(2), and for the walking sessions it was 10(2).\nCONCLUSIONS: %peak .VO(2), %HRmax, and RPE were significantly higher for aerobic dance than for walking. However, both the aerobic dance and walking sessions were of adequate intensity to improve aerobic fitness in most subjects.

Although leg power and leg strength were greatly correlated (r = .89) in a comparison of bivariate analyses of strength or power with physical performance, leg power modeled up to 8% more of the variance for five of six physical performance measures. Despite limitations in sample size, it appeared that, through quadratic modeling,the influence of leg power on physical performance was curvilinear. Using separate multivariate analyses, partial R2 values for leg power and leg strength were compared, demonstrating that leg power accounted for 2% to 8% more of the variance with all measures of physical performance.\nCONCLUSION: Leg power is an important factor influencing the physical performance of mobility-limited older people. Although related to strength, it is a separate attribute that may exert a greater influence on physical performance.

In PA records, overestimation of EE was greater with older age and higher body fatness; EE was overestimated by 16.7% among men 50 years and older compared with only 5.3% among men <40 years of age. For percentage of body fat, EE was overestimated by 19.7% among men with a percentage of body fat > or =30% compared with only 5.6% among men with a percentage of body fat <25%. A trend for less overestimation of EE with higher levels of PA (measured by DLW/basal metabolic rate [BMR]) also was observed in the PA records. In the 7DR, the estimates of EE varied widely and no trends were observed by age, percentage of body fat, and PA levels.\nDISCUSSION: Estimation of EE from the 7DR is considerably more variable than from PA records. Factors related to age and percentage of body fat influenced the accuracy of estimated EE in the PA record. Additional studies are needed to understand factors related to accurate reporting of PA behaviors, which are used to estimate EE in free-living adults."

        "year": 2001,
        "abstract_content": "Acclimatization to moderate high altitude accompanied by training at low altitude (living high-training low) has been shown to improve sea level endurance performance in accomplished, but not elite, runners. Whether elite athletes, who may be closer to the maximal structural and functional adaptive capacity of the respiratory (i.e., oxygen transport from environment to mitochondria) system, may achieve similar performance gains is unclear. To answer this question, we studied 14 elite men and 8 elite women before and after 27 days of living at 2,500 m while performing high-intensity training at 1,250 m. The altitude sojourn began 1 wk after the USA Track and Field National Championships, when the athletes were close to their season's fitness peak. Sea level 3,000-m time trial performance was significantly improved by 1.1% (95% confidence limits 0.3-1.9%). One-third of the athletes achieved personal best times for the distance after the altitude training camp. The improvement in running performance was accompanied by a 3% improvement in maximal oxygen uptake (72.1 +/- 1.5 to 74.4 +/- 1.5 ml x kg(-1) x min(-1)). Circulating erythropoietin levels were near double initial sea level values 20 h after ascent (8.5 +/- 0.5 to 16.2 +/- 1.0 IU/ml). Soluble transferrin receptor levels were significantly elevated on the 19th day at altitude, confirming a stimulation of erythropoiesis (2.1 +/- 0.7 to 2.5 +/- 0.6 microg/ml). Hb concentration measured at sea level increased 1 g/dl over the course of the camp (13.3 +/- 0.2 to 14.3 +/- 0.2 g/dl). We conclude that 4 wk of acclimatization to moderate altitude, accompanied by high-intensity training at low altitude, improves sea level endurance performance even in elite runners. Both the mechanism and magnitude of the effect appear similar to that observed in less accomplished runners, even for athletes who may have achieved near maximal oxygen transport capacity for humans."

        "year": 2001,
        "abstract_content": "BACKGROUND: The study assessed a way to increase the intensity and effectiveness of resistance training by comparing training with a slower repetition speed to training with a conventional repetition speed. Slower repetition speed may effectively increase intensity throughout the lifting phase while decreasing momentum.\nMETHODS: Two studies were done with untrained men (N=65) and women (N=82), (mean age=53.6) who trained two to three times per week for eight to 10 weeks on a 13 exercise Nautilus circuit performing one set of each exercise. Participants exclusively trained using regular speed repetitions for 8 to 12 repetitions per set at 7 sec each (2 sec lifting, 1 sec pause, 4 sec lowering) or a Super Slow training protocol where they completed 4 to 6 repetitions per set at 14 sec each (10 sec lifting, 4 sec lowering). All of the participants were tested for either the 10 repetition-maximum (RM) weightload (regular-speed group) or the 5-RM weightload (slow-speed group).\nRESULTS: In both studies, Super-Slow training resulted in about a 50% greater increase (p<0.001) in strength for both men and women than regular speed training. In Study 1, the Super-Slow training group showed a mean increase of 12.0 kg and the regular speed group showed an increase of 8.0 kg increase (p<0.001). In Study 2, the Super-Slow training group showed a 10.9 kg increase and the regular speed group showed an increase of 7.1 kg (p<0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Super-Slow training is an effective method for middle-aged and older adults to increase strength. Although studies still need to be done with at-risk populations, repetition speed should be considered when prescribing resistance training."

        "abstract_content": "PURPOSE: This study determined whether exercise (30 min)-rest (10 min) cycles alter physiologic tolerance to uncompensable heat stress (UCHS) when outdoors in the desert. In addition, the relationship between core temperature and exhaustion from heat strain previously established in laboratory studies was compared with field studies.\nMETHODS: Twelve men completed four trials: moderate intensity continuous exercise (MC), moderate intensity exercise with intermittent rest (MI), hard intensity continuous exercise (HC), and hard intensity exercise with intermittent rest (HI). UCHS was achieved by wearing protective clothing and exercising (estimated at 420 W or 610 W) outdoors in desert heat.\nRESULTS: Heat Stress Index values were 200%, 181%, 417%, and 283% for MC, MI, HC, and HI, respectively. Exhaustion from heat strain occurred in 36 of 48 trials. Core temperatures at exhaustion averaged 38.6 +/- 0.5 degrees, 38.9 +/- 0.6 degrees, 38.9 +/- 0.7 degrees, and 39.0 +/- 0.7 degrees C for MC, MI, HC, and HI, respectively. Core temperature at exhaustion was not altered (P > 0.05) by exercise intensity or exercise-rest cycles and 50% of subjects incurred exhaustion at core temperature of 39.4 degrees C. These field data were compared with laboratory and field data collected over the past 35 years. Aggregate data for 747 laboratory and 131 field trials indicated that 50% of subjects incurred exhaustion at core temperatures of 38.6 degrees and 39.5 degrees C, respectively. When heat intolerant subjects (exhaustion < 38.3 degrees C core temperature) were removed from the analysis, subjects from laboratory studies (who underwent short-term acclimation) still demonstrated less (0.8 degrees C) physiological tolerance than those from field studies (who underwent long-term acclimatization).\nCONCLUSION: Exercise-rest cycles did not alter physiologic tolerance to UCHS. In addition, subjects from field studies demonstrate greater physiologic tolerance than subjects from laboratory studies."

        "year": 2000,
        "abstract_content": "More than 90% of all sudden cardiac deaths (SCDs) during downhill skiing, the most popular winter sport world-wide, are attributed to men over the age of 34. However, no data exist on additional risk factors and triggers for SCD related to downhill skiing. Therefore risk factor profiles of 68 males who died from SCD during downhill skiing were compared to those of 204 matched controls. Skiers who suffered SCD had much more frequently prior myocardial infarction (MI) (41% vs. 1.5%; p<0.001), hypertension (50% vs. 17%; p<0.001), known coronary heart disease (CHD) without prior MI (9% vs. 3%; p=0.05) and were less engaged in strenuous exercise (4% vs. 15%; p<0.05) when compared to controls. Multivariate analyses even enhanced the importance of these risk factors. Downhill skiing is considered to be a serious trigger for SCD especially in skiers with prior MI but also for those with hypertension, known CHD without prior MI, or insufficient adaptation to strenuous exercise. Skiing-related increased sympathetic activity might well disturb the autonomic balance with subsequent arrhythmias and/or may increase cardiac work and platelet aggregability with possible plaque rupture and coronary thrombosis. Therefore adaptation to high intensity exercise and therapeutic interventions or abstinence from skiing in certain cases should be considered for downhill skiers at high risk."

Participants performed constant work rate (WR) tests at 0, 25, and 50 W (at 60 rpm) for 6 minutes in a randomized sequence: gross VO2, gross efficiency, and work efficiency were related to TBM and LM as assessed by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. We found that gross VO2 and gross efficiency were more strongly related to LM than TBM but work efficiency values were independent of both (P>0.05). Significantly higher values of VO2TBM were found in subjects with large LM/TBM ratios and vice-versa; VO2/LM, however, did not change with anthropometric characteristics. Gross VO2 (mL/min) was predicted by a LM-based equation (10.6 [WR, W] + 16.8 [LM, kg] +75) with a mean error below 5%: this equation predicted the cost more accurately than previous TBM-based formulations (P<0.01). We conclude that leg mass actually provides the preferred frame of reference for predicting the oxygen cost for cycle ergometry at 60 rpm in sedentary subjects, independent of age or gender."

        "abstract_content": "This study focuses on an assessment of perceived health promotion needs and interests among predominantly older low-income women (76%) in the state of Pennsylvania. A questionnaire was completed by a convenience sample of 140 individuals attending four senior centers and two nutrition sites. In addition, 14 focus groups with an average of 8 members per group were conducted for a total of 105 people from two of the four senior centers. The health topics of greatest interest to women were exercise (57.6%), making friends (50.9%), nutrition (37.5%), losing weight (33.6%), and home safety (34.6%). Compared with women, men were significantly more interested in exercise and its effect on mood (41.3% versus 24.0%) and love and sex after 60 (44.8% versus 18.2%) and significantly less interested in nutrition (17.2% versus 37.5%). The fitness activities of greatest interest to women were walking (63.1%), back exercises (37.5%), toning to music (22.1%), and self-defense (18.2%), none of which was significantly different from the men in the sample. Results suggest that many of the key health needs perceived by low-income older women could be addressed by a combination of fitness activities and health education, especially if they are also designed to facilitate social interactions. The barriers to participation in such programs most often cited were transportation, scheduling, and cost factors. Fortunately, many communities already have the resources to offer low-cost interventions in the areas of need, such as walking groups, self-defense, and home safety. Communities interested in serving low-income older women should more closely examine the barriers and the unmet needs of this group when designing intervention programs."

However, it is not known how age and gender influence the hypotensive effects of exercise. A total of 109 sedentary subjects with stage 1 or 2 essential hypertension performed exercise training at mild intensity for 8 weeks with a combination of various exercises at 22 fitness clubs. Blood pressure (BP) was reduced significantly during the program in all of the 4 exercise subgroups classified by age and gender (-15/-11 mm Hg in men aged 30 to 49 years, -10/-5 mm Hg in men aged 50 to 69 years, -16/-14 mm Hg in women aged 30 to 49 years, and -10/-6 mm Hg in women aged 50 to 69 years). There was a significant (p <0.01) age x time interaction for both systolic and diastolic BP. However, no significant gender x time interaction was observed over the same time period. After adjustment for baseline BP, exercise duration, and changes in body mass and salt intake, a significant (p <0.01) age effect difference also was observed with reduction in BP at weeks 4 and 8. There were no significant changes in any of these variables in the 42 other hypertensive control subjects. Thus, (1) a clinically significant reduction in BP was produced with the combination of various exercises performed at fitness clubs, (2) older hypertensive subjects experienced smaller reductions in BP than younger counterparts at weeks 4 and 8, and (3) gender did not influence the efficacy of physical activity for lowering elevated BP."

The prevalence of functional limitation was higher among women than men. Physically fit and physically active participants reported less functional limitation than unfit or sedentary participants. After controlling for age and other risk factors, the prevalence of functional limitation was lower for both moderately fit (odds ratio = 0.4, 95% CI = 0.2-0.6) and high fit men (odds ratio = 0.3, 95% CI = 0.2-0.4), compared with low fit men. Corresponding figures for women were 0.5 (0.3-0.7) and 0.3 (0.2-0.5) for moderately fit and high fit women. The association between physical activity and functional limitation was similar to the data for physical fitness.\nCONCLUSIONS: These data support a protective effect of physical fitness and physical activity on functional limitation among older adults and extend this protective effect to middle-aged men and women."

Data were collected in a research laboratory with a clinical exercise testing room. Eight regular caffeine users and eight men who did not habitually consume caffeine were studied. Each subject consumed of a beverage once with and once without 4.5 mg caffeine/kg fat-free mass added to the drink. Following consumption each subject walked at three intensities of exercise (30, 50, and 70% of VO2peak). Measures of BP were obtained by the auscultatory technique.\nRESULTS: Caffeine consumption resulted in significant increases in both systolic BP and diastolic BP at rest and during exercise. The elevation during exercise was 7-8 mmHg at all three exercise intensities for systolic BP; however, for diastolic BP there was only a significant elevation (4 mmHg) at the highest exercise intensity. No differences were noted between those men who regularly consume and those who regularly abstain from caffeine. There was a wide range in the resting BP response to caffeine (combined SBP and DBP ranged from 10-39 mmHg) suggesting that there are marked differences in sensitivity to caffeine, irrespective of individuals' consumption habits.\nCONCLUSIONS: Consideration should be given to caffeine intake prior to exercise in patients for whom an additional increase in BP during exercise would not be desirable."

        "year": 1997,
        "abstract_content": "Increasing the precision of measurements of total energy expenditure in population-based epidemiological studies is important for accurately quantifying the relationship between this exposure and disease. Current questionnaire-based methods cannot accurately quantify total energy expenditure, although they may provide an estimate of the frequency of vigorous activities. Heart rate monitoring with individual calibration has been advocated as a method for assessing energy expenditure in field studies and has been compared with the 'gold standard' techniques of doubly-labelled water and indirect calorimetry. However the method has previously only been used on small and selected populations. This study was, therefore, established to test the feasibility of using heart rate monitoring in a population-based study of adults. A total of 167 individuals aged 30-40 years were randomly selected and underwent 4 d heart-rate monitoring. Only three individuals could not complete the protocol. The mean physical activity level (PAL) measured over 4 d was 1.89 (SD 0.40) in men and 1.76 (sd 0.31) in women. There was no difference between mean PAL on weekend days compared with weekdays (mean paired difference 0.0008, 95% CI -0.06 +0.06). The estimate of mean PAL was not correlated with BMI, percentage body fat or the waist:hip ratio. It was, however, correlated with cardio-respiratory fitness as measured by VO2(max) per kg (Spearman rank correlation coefficient 0.50 in men and 0.42 in women). The pattern of energy expenditure was assessed by calculating the percentage of daytime hours in which PAL was greater than five times basal energy expenditure. This measure was strongly correlated with the mean PAL in both men (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.77) and women (0.71). We conclude that heart-rate monitoring is a feasible method for assessing the pattern and total level of energy expenditure in medium-sized epidemiological studies. It may also prove useful as the reference technique for calibrating questionnaires to estimate energy expenditure in larger scale studies."

Eight healthy men performed unilateral knee extensor exercise (8 sets/approximately 10 repetitions/approximately 85% of 1 single maximal repetition). They received a carbohydrate (CHO) supplement (1 g/kg) or placebo (Pl) immediately (t = 0 h) and 1 h (t = +1 h) postexercise. FSR was determined for exercised (Ex) and control (Con) limbs by incremental L-[1-13C]leucine enrichment into the vastus lateralis over approximately 10 h postexercise. Insulin was greater (P < 0.01) at 0.5, 0.75, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, and 2 h, and glucose was greater (P < 0.05) at 0.5 and 0.75 h for CHO compared with Pl condition. FSR was 36.1% greater in the CHO/Ex leg than in the CHO/Con leg (P = not significant) and 6.3% greater in the Pl/Ex leg than in the Pl/Con leg (P = not significant). 3-Methylhistidine excretion was lower in the CHO (110.43 +/- 3.62 mumol/g creatinine) than P1 condition (120.14 +/- 5.82, P < 0.05) as was urinary urea nitrogen (8.60 +/- 0.66 vs. 12.28 +/- 1.84 g/g creatinine, P < 0.05). This suggests that CHO supplementation (1 g/kg) immediately and 1 h after resistance exercise can decrease myofibrillar protein breakdown and urinary urea excretion, resulting in a more positive body protein balance."

In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of 39 physically active men with uncomplicated essential hypertension, we compared the effects of atenolol and enalapril on cardiovascular fitness and serum lipids. Drugs (atenolol, 50 or 100 mg once daily; enalapril, 10 or 20 mg once daily) were each administered for 4 weeks and each active drug period was preceded by 4 weeks of placebo therapy. Both drugs effectively (p < 0.001) lowered resting blood pressure when measured at the time of theoretical peak (i.e., 3 to 4 hours postdrug) and trough (i.e., 24 hours postdrug) drug blood levels. Atenolol reduced maximal oxygen uptake (by 7.3%, p < 0.001) 3 to 4, but not 24, hours after drug ingestion; no changes occurred with enalapril. Similarly, whereas serum lipids were essentially unchanged with enalapril, serum triglycerides (18.9% increase), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (10.6% decrease), and ratio of low-density to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (15.4% increase) were adversely impacted (p < or = 0.05) with atenolol. It is concluded that in contrast to enalapril, atenolol adversely impacts cardiovascular fitness and serum lipids and lipoproteins in physically active hypertensive men."

The sample was randomly divided in an experimental group of 13 older subjects (3 men and 10 women, mean age 63.5 +/- 3 years) while the remaining 9 subjects (3 men and 6 women, mean age 64.2 +/- 4 years) served as inactive control group. After medical screening all participants were evaluated before and after 12 weeks in which the experimental subjects underwent a low intensity training. Each subjects-either inactive or active-performed two treadmill tests at two-days interval, to measure maximal and submaximal responses to exercise, respectively. Heart rate (HR), oxygen uptake (VO2) and pulmonary ventilation (VE) were measured using a telemetric apparatus.\nRESULTS: The major finding of the study was the significant improvement in submaximal response to exercise of experimental subjects, expressed by the reduction in HR, VO2 VE while VO2 max did not change.\nCONCLUSIONS: Thus, it appears that a low intensity general training similar to that followed in the present study may represent a good means to improve physical fitness in healthy elderly people. Similarly, this study supports the effectiveness of evaluation tests based on submaximal responses to exercise in this population."

The second purpose was to assess adherence to training six months after conclusion of the initiation period. Forty-six apparently healthy older adults (mean age = 71.3; 33 women; 13 men) trained one hour, three days a week, for 4 months on a Nautilus Multi-Station Unit. The subjects trained on five upper extremity, three trunk, and three lower extremity stations. Training sessions consisted of 50 minutes of strength training and 10 minutes of flexibility exercises. Baseline exercise habits were obtained from the subjects using the Physical Exercise Profile (PEP). Subjects also completed portions of the PEP immediately following the conclusion of the 4-month intervention and 6 months later. The data were analyzed by chi square contingency tables. The subjects had over a 95% initiation rate during the study. Exercise leadership and program organization were found to be the most important reasons for the high initiation rate. Two determinants that influenced older adults to continue training were identified: satisfaction with the exercise routine and body image. These results indicate that exercise programs designed for older adults should emphasize exercise leadership to facilitate program initiation and subsequent exercise adherence."

        "abstract_content": "Based on a theoretical approach from world record running data, we have previously calculated that the most suitable duration for measuring maximal aerobic velocity (Vamax) by a field test was 5 min (Vamax(5)). The aim of this study was, therefore, to check this hypothesis on 48 men of various levels of physical fitness by comparing (Vmax(5)) with (Vamax) determined at the last step of a progressive treadmill exercise test when the subject felt exhausted (Vamax(t)) and during a test on a running track, behind a cyclist (following an established protocol) (Vamax(c)). For each test, (VO2max) was also measured by a direct method on a treadmill (VO2max(1)) and calculated by an equation for field tests (VO2max(5) and VO2max(c)). The Vamax(5) [17.1 (SD 2.2) km.h-1] and (Vamax(c)) [(18.2 (SD 2.4) km.h-1] were significantly higher than (Vamax(t)) [16.9 (SD 2.6) km.h-1; P < 0.001]. The (Vamax(t)) was strongly correlated with (Vamax(5)) (r = 0.94) and (Vamax(c)) (r = 0.95) (P < 0.001). The best identity and correlation between (Vamax(5)) and track performances were found in the runners (n = 9) with experience over a distance of 3,000 m. The VO2max(5) and (VO2max(c)) were higher than VO2max(t) (+ 5.0% and + 13.7%, respectively; P < 0.001) and VO2max(t) was highly correlated with Vamax(5) (r = 0.90; P < 0.001). These results suggest that the 5-min field test, easy to apply, provided precise information on Vamax and to a lesser degree on VO2max."

        "abstract_content": "The abdomen is the principal site of fat deposition in men, and because abdominal fat is readily mobilized during exercise, the relative proportion of fat in the abdominal site may negatively correlate with the amount of regular physical activity, and even with physical fitness. This study presents data for regional fatness in 165 fit young men (U.S. Army Ranger candidates; initial body fat = 14.7 +/- 4.7%) assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), and for relative changes occurring following a 13% weight loss produced by a 1000 kcal.d-1 energy deficit over 8 wk. Fat-free mass was constant across quintiles of percent body fat; only fat mass was different (16.2 +/- 2.2 kg and 6.0 +/- 1.4 kg at upper and lower quintiles, respectively). Truncal fat accounted for about 41% of total body fat in all quintiles; only the proportion of fat distributed to the arms was significantly higher in the fattest quintiles of men. Among a group of less intensely trained soldiers with the same average fatness as the highest quintile of Ranger students (20%), relative fat distribution to the trunk approached 50% of the total fat. Following weight loss, Ranger students lost half of the fat in all regions assessed (legs, arms, and trunk). The only significant association between regional losses and initial fatness was a greater proportion of fat lost from the arms in the fattest Rangers. These data suggest a \"fit fat\" distribution in active young men in which fat remains in the arms and legs until extreme weight loss occurs and the metabolically more active abdominal fat approaches depletion."

        "year": 1996,
        "abstract_content": "BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic evidence suggests that 8,368 kJ or 2000 kcal per week of moderate physical activity, including walking and stair climbing, can reduce risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). The goal of this study was to assess the effects of this amount of these two activities on physical fitness and risk factors for CHD.\nMETHODS: Twenty-two healthy, slightly overweight, sedentary, normotensive, normolipemic men, age 22 to 44 years, were randomly assigned to an exercise or control group for 12 weeks followed by a 4-week washout period. The subjects then were crossed-over to the alternate group for an additional 12-week period. Exercise consisted of 5 days per week of supervised treadmill exercise plus stair climbing. Treadmill exercise consisted of walking for 45 minutes at 5.15 km per hour at 2% grade for a total of 19.3 km per week. Subjects also climbed 10 floors of stairs at a time at their own pace without prescribed target heart rates for a total of 50 floors per week. The estimated total weekly energy cost of the treadmill walking plus stair climbing was 8,368 kJ or 2,000 kcal. Mean observed heart rates were 55% and 82% of maximal heart rate during treadmill walking and stair climbing, respectively. Data from the two exercise periods and two control periods were pooled and compared by analysis of variance.\nRESULTS: Sixteen subjects completed all phases of the study. Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) by the Bruce treadmill exercise protocol with metabolic gas measurements was below average for age at baseline, and was not significantly affected by 12 weeks of training. No significant changes were noted between groups in body weight or percent body fat (hydrostatic weighing), although there was a trend for loss of weight and fat with exercise training. Mean systolic blood pressure (119 mm Hg) was unchanged in both groups. However, diastolic blood pressure (72 mm Hg and 78 mm Hg for the treatment and control groups, respectively) showed an unexpected 6 mm Hg increase during the exercise period and a 5 mm Hg decline during the control period. Mean plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels were unaffected by training, except for a 16% reduction in triglycerides (P < .05). However, a 28% increase in plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (P < .01) was noted during the initial 12-week training period, which regressed during the washout period, and was not replicated during the second 12-week exercise period.\nCONCLUSIONS: Twelve weeks of walking and stair climbing at a moderate pace and intensity at an energy cost of about 2,000 kcal per week failed to improve physical fitness or risk factors for CHD. A reduction in physical activities other than the prescribed exercise program, as reported by a physical activity recall questionnaire, probably contributed to an absence of an exercise response. A longer and/or a more intense activity program is apparently required to improve these modalities."

The influences of baseline behavioral, social, and psychological characteristics on patterns of change in performance over 2.5 years are examined.\nMETHODS: A cohort of relatively high-functioning men and women, aged 70-79, identified in 1988 by subsampling from three community-based studies on the basis of physical and cognitive function. Baseline assessments included physical performance, sociodemographic characteristics, health status, and behavioral, social, and psychological characteristics. A summary measure of physical performance was developed from tests of balance, gait, lower body strength and coordination, and manual dexterity. In-home assessments were repeated at follow-up in 1991.\nRESULTS: Linear regression models were used to identify significant behavioral, social, and psychological predictors of better performance at follow-up, controlling for known sociodemographic and health status predictors. Significant, independent associations with better performance were found for participation in moderate and/or strenuous exercise activity and greater frequency of emotional support from social networks, particularly among those reporting low frequency of instrumental support. These effects remained significant independent of incident health conditions during follow-up. None of the psychological characteristics was a significant predictor.\nCONCLUSIONS: Maintenance of better physical performance within a high-functioning cohort is influenced by prior exercise behavior and social network emotional support. Observed patterns of both decline and improvement in performance suggest that older age is not uniformly associated with declines. Predictors of better performance identified here may offer potential for effective interventions to promote more successful aging."

        "abstract_content": "BACKGROUND: Although exercise parameters such as intensity and format have been shown to influence exercise participation rates and physiological outcomes in the short term, few data are available evaluating their longer-term effects. The study objective was to determine the 2-year effects of differing intensities and formats of endurance exercise on exercise participation rates, fitness, and plasma HDL cholesterol levels among healthy older adults.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Higher-intensity, group-based exercise training; higher-intensity, home-based exercise; and lower-intensity, home-based exercise were compared in a 2-year randomized trial. Participants were 149 men and 120 postmenopausal women 50 to 65 years of age who were sedentary and free of cardiovascular disease. Recruitment was achieved through a random digit-dial community telephone survey and media promotion. All exercise occurred in community settings. For higher-intensity exercise training, three 40-minute endurance training sessions per week were prescribed at 73% to 88% of peak treadmill heart rate. For lower-intensity exercise, five 30-minute endurance training sessions per week were prescribed at 60% to 73% of peak treadmill heart rate. Treadmill exercise performance, lipoprotein levels and other heart disease risk factors, and exercise adherence were evaluated at baseline and across the 2-year period. Treadmill exercise test performance improved for all three training conditions during year 1 and was successfully maintained during year 2, particularly for subjects in the higher-intensity, home-based condition. Subjects in that condition also showed the greatest year 2 exercise adherence rates (P < .003). Although no significant increases in HDL cholesterol were observed during year 1, by the end of year 2 subjects in the two home-based training conditions showed small but significant HDL cholesterol increases over baseline (P < .01). The increases were particularly pronounced for subjects in the lower-intensity condition, whose exercise prescription required more frequent exercise sessions per week. For all exercise conditions, increases in HDL cholesterol were associated with decreases in waist-to-hip ratio in both men and women (P < .04).\nCONCLUSIONS: While older adults can benefit from initiating a regular regimen of moderate-intensity exercise in terms of improved fitness levels and small improvements in HDL cholesterol levels, the time frame needed to achieve HDL cholesterol change (2 years) may be longer than that reported previously for younger populations. Frequency of participation may be particularly important for achieving such changes. Supervised home-based exercise regimens represent a safe, attractive alternative for achieving sustained participation."

        "authors": "Armstrong AL, Wallace WA",
        "year": 1994,
        "abstract_content": "Hip fractures are common in the elderly, affecting 1 in 4 women by the age of 90 years and 1 in 8 men. These fractures have caused an \"epidemic\" during the last 20 years because the age specific rate for such fractures has doubled, and there has been a significant increase in the size of the elderly population in Europe. Hip fracture patients occupy a quarter of all orthopedic beds, the treatment is costly and the rehabilitation slow. Fifteen percent die in hospital; 33% are dead by one year. Of survivors only 2/3 return to their own home. There is now a move to prevent such fractures. Hip fractures arise in the elderly for two reasons: deteriorating bone stock and increasing falls. Hip fracture prevention needs to address both issues, but most work has looked at bone stock. Predictions of hip fracture risk even if based on bone density are poor, so preventive measures need to target the whole population. Bone density rises to a peak at 35 to 40 years in both sexes; men have a higher bone density at all times than women. Thereafter there is a steady loss of 1-2% per year. Women have 10 years of accelerated loss after the menopause. Hip fracture prevention starts by ensuring that peak bone mass is reached. This is under genetic influence but may be maximized by adequate dietary calcium and physical activity in adolescence. Smoking, alcohol and steroid use reduce bone density and their use should be moderated. In women amenorrhea reduces bone density. For women, estrogen may stop menopausal loss and maintain bone density for at least 15 years and in retrospective studies can reduce the fracture risk by 50%. Calcitonin may be an alternative. Five years beyond the menopause primary or secondary prevention may be started. Estrogen is still the best therapy but may be less popular because of the return of menstrual periods. Calcitonin or oral calcium supplements may also be of benefit. Drugs in combination may be more effective than alone. Over age 70, when calcium absorption diminishes, vitamin D, calcium and calcitonin may be effective. For men, treatment options are calcium, calcitonin or, later on, vitamin D. The role of exercise in bone density protection is unclear but should be encouraged for general health reasons. Bisphosphonates are new drugs that may be useful. Falls become increasingly common in the elderly such that up to 80% of all 80-year-olds may sustain at least one fall per year.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

        "abstract_content": "This experiment examined the effect of physical exercise on measures of cognitive performance, Raven's Matrices, and an adaptation of the revised WAIS arithmetic subtest. We also tested the inverted-U hypothesis of an interactive relation between exercise-induced arousal and cognitive performance. 50 physically active men were assigned to five groups (n = 10) of equal physical fitness based on predicted maximum oxygen uptake. Three exercise groups undertook bench stepping at mean power outputs of either 47, 75, or 120 watts. One control group played Bingo and another control had no activity. There was no change in the Raven's Matrices scores pre- to posttest intervention, neither were there any between-group differences either pre- or posttest. The arithmetic scores were significantly higher over-all (p < .05) on the posttest, but there were no reliable differences between groups either pre- or posttest. These results suggest that short duration (6 min.) aerobic exercise has no effect on cognitive performance. This finding supports the majority of previous studies that used step-up tasks to examine the relation between physical exercise and cognitive performance."

Bicycle exercise was performed at workloads of 50-150 W in a climatic chamber at ambient temperatures of 10-40 degrees C (relative humidity 45-55%). Skin temperatures at seven or eight points over the body surface were measured using thermography and thermocouple recording systems. Sweat rates were significantly higher at 40 degrees C than at 30 degrees C, whereas the fall in skin temperature was almost equal. The reduction of skin temperature during exercise was the same throughout the year, although sweat rate was significantly higher in summer than in winter. In coloured thermographics of the skin temperature distribution during exercise of both 50 and 150 W at 10 or 20 degrees C, the skin temperature began to decline immediately at the onset of the exercise. Increased work intensities reduced skin temperature. The results suggest that fall in skin temperature during initial exercise was not due to increased evaporative cooling but to vasoconstriction, probably caused by non-thermal factors."

Training was associated with a significant increment of the peak oxygen intake during arm-crank tests except in control subjects and those combining a low intensity (50% of peak) with short-duration training (20-min sessions). There were associated increases in cardiac stroke volume, as assessed by a carbon dioxide rebreathing technique during submaximal exercise. It is suggested that the performance of inactive wheelchair users is limited by a pooling of blood in paralysed regions, with a reduction of cardiac preloading; nevertheless, substantial gains of performance are possible through prolonged arm-crank exercise of moderate intensity."

This is combined with a danger: coronary atherosclerosis responsible for 90 p. cent of the sudden deaths episodes seen in sports, in men over the age of 40/50. Even in France, a country that is not traditionally sports oriented (Pierre de Coubertin and a few occasional champions are really exceptions masking the non-existent sports activities in school)-sports have become a society phenomenon, on a par with the development of leisure, a younger retirement age, increased unemployment and the ageing of the population. Twelve millions of french people hold a sport license and more that twenty millions practice a sport more or less regularly. As epidemiologic studies are in a great majority as well as secondary prevention, it is possible to assert that there is no topic more frequently discussed today than that of physical activities in cardiology consultations. Often, french physicians are not well equipped to answer questions of provide judicious advice: because, very often, these physicians do not practice any sport and/or they are not convinced of the advantages of physical exercise and unfamiliar with the specific restrictions of each sport. In addition, they cannot perform a stress-test in their office--as in this domaine our country is also far behind."

Sixteen women (mean age = 24.7 yrs) were evaluated during progressive LBNP to -50 torr. Each subject's VO2max was determined using indirect calorimetry during the Bruce protocol exercise test. Eight subjects [mean VO2max = 56.8 (ml O2 X min-1) X kg-1] were designated as trained, and eight subjects [mean VO2max = 39.4 (ml O2 X min-1) X kg-1] were designated as untrained. During LBNP, heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac index, forearm blood flow, and leg circumference were measured. All subjects completed the LBNP protocol without clinical symptoms of pre-syncope. The over-all hemodynamic responses of both groups to LBNP were qualitatively similar to previous findings reported for males. However, no significant differences in response of hemodynamic variables were observed between trained and untrained subjects during LBNP to -50 torr (P greater than 0.05) except for vascular resistance and diastolic blood pressure at -50 torr where the untrained value was greater than the trained value. This would suggest that a fitness-related difference may have been present at higher levels of LBNP. Furthermore, in contrast to previous reports in males, the index of baroreflex responsiveness (delta heart rate/delta systolic blood pressure) was similar for both groups (P greater than 0.05). When these data were compared with a similar subject pool of males, the females displayed a significantly greater (P less than 0.05) tolerance of LBNP to -50 torr regardless of fitness.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Twenty-four sedentary male volunteers, aged 20 to 50 years, underwent right-sided cardiac catheterization, arterial cannulation, radionuclide angiography and expired gas analysis for detailed evaluation of central and peripheral cardiovascular function during submaximal and maximal exercise. Habitual physical activity level varied but was well matched across the age range. Over the 3-decade age range studied, there was no detectable change in cardiovascular function at rest. When peak exercise variables were examined, an age-related 25% decrease in O2 consumption was noted (r = -0.43, p = 0.04); this was associated with a 25% decrease in peak cardiac index (r = -0.54, p = 0.01) and a 20% decrease in peak heart rate (r = -0.63, p = 0.002). In addition, there was an age-related increase in calculated systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances and an increase in left ventricular ejection time. No age relation was seen for exercise stroke volume index, end-diastolic volume index, end-systolic volume index, pulmonary artery wedge pressure, ejection fraction or arteriovenous O2 difference. These results indicate that the age-related decline in aerobic work performance among men aged 20 to 50 years results primarily from a reduced exercise heart rate in older subjects rather than from a reduction in stroke volume or peripheral O2 utilization."

The risk factors--serum cholesterol, serum triglycerides, blood pressure and body fat (sum of three skinfolds)--were measured; the incidence of cigarette smoking was obtained from a questionnaire. The total population tested was divided into three age groups which were subdivided into four fitness categories. An inverse relationship was demonstrated between fitness category and the mean values for all measured risk factors. Although this relationship was most evident in the older subjects, it is significant that it was also present in men under 30 years of age. A similar inverse relationship was demonstrated for all age groups between fitness category and the percent of subjects considered to have an elevated cholesterol, triglyceride, blood pressure, or skinfold thickness. The incidence of cigarette smoking was inversely related to fitness category only in those 30 years of age and over. Although this type of cross-sectional study does not establish cause and effect, there is evidence to suggest that participation in a program to improve physical fitness may lead the individual to modify other components of his lifestyle."

        "abstract_content": "In a study population of 14,998 Harvard male alumni, 681 hypertensives were first diagnosed during a 6-10-year follow-up beginning 16-50 years after college entrance. The study comprised 105,662 man-years of observation of these men who had entered college in 1916-1950, and who were followed from 1962 or 1966 to 1972. Presence or absence of a background of collegiate sports did not influence risk of hypertension in this study population, nor did stair-climbing, walking, or light sports play by alumni. But, alumni who did not engage in vigorous sports play were at 35% greater risk of hypertension than those who did, and this relationship held at all ages, 35-74 years. Higher levels of body mass index, weight gain since college, history of parental hypertension, and lack of strenuous exercise independently predicted increased risk of hypertension in alumni. Men 20% or more over ideal weight-for-height were at 78% greater risk than lighter men. Those who had gained 25+ lbs (c. 11.5+ kg) since entering college were at 60% greater risk than those who had gained less. Alumni with a hypertensive parent were at 83% higher risk than men without such parentage. Contemporary vigorous exercise was inversely related to hypertension risk, but chiefly among alumni overweight-for-height. In the clinical sense, attributable risk estimates ranged from 30% to nearly 50% for the alumni characteristics of overweight, weight gain, parental hypertension, and lack of vigorous exercise. In the community sense, attributable risk of these same characteristics ranged 13-26%. To sum up, vigorous exercise is associated with lower hypertension incidence, and, without necessarily altering body weight-for-height, avoids or reduces fat and promotes muscle; obesity, rather than excess weight-for-height, is associated with higher hypertension incidence; hence, vigorous exercise is appropriate for use as an intervention regimen in the prevention of hypertension."

        "title": "Improving physical fitness by exercise training programs.",
        "authors": "Blair SN, Chandler JV, Ellisor DB, Langley T",
        "year": 1980,
        "abstract_content": "Thirteen young men completed a ten-week exercise training program on bicycle ergometers. Training sessions were conducted five days per week, with eight men randomly assigned to low-effort (LE) and five to high-effort (HE) regimens. LE participants worked continuously at 50% of their maximal oxygen intake (exercise HR congruent to 135 BPM); HE participants performed two minutes alternating work-rest intervals at 80% of their maximal oxygen intake (exercise HR congruent to 170 BPM). Total work done was held constant for the two groups. LE and HE participants increased maximal oxygen intake (P < .01), but there was no difference in changes between the two groups. LE exercise training programs are more comfortable for participants and perhaps should be recommended over HE programs for most individuals, since improvements in physical fitness appear to be comparable."

        "authors": "Tiedt N, Wohlgemuth B, Wohlgemuth P",
        "year": 1975,
        "abstract_content": "Dynamic characteristics of heart rate in response to sinusoidal variations of work load were analysed in 8 male and 3 female untrained students exercising in a sitting position on a bicycle ergometer. The mean work load was 90 watt in men and 60 watt in women, the amplitudes being 50 and 30 watt respectively. Nine different frequencies were used, the periods varying from 0.5 to 15.0 min. By means of harmonic analysis, the fundamental components in the response of the heart rate have been shown to prevail over the 2nd and 3rd harmonics, indicating a mainly linear behaviour of the control system in the work-load range studied. A comparison of the frequency response of untrained males and females observed in this study and of trained sportsmen, investigated by wigertz (1970), reveals differences between the groups. The individual and ensemble mean frequency responses have been described by several transfer functions, the best fit having been obtained with functions containing two time constants including one with a highly damped oscillating element. The dominating dynamic parameter is a time constant of about 20 to 30 sec. This time constant tends to be shorter and its portion of the frequency response diminishes in order from the untrained females and males to the trained sportsmen. The individual time constant decreases as the PWC170 increases, and is therefore a suitable criterion for estimating the physical performance of individuals under dynamic conditions."

        "authors": "Cumming GR, Borysyk L, Dufresne C",
        "year": 1972,
        "abstract_content": "Lead MC5 bipolar exercise ECG was obtained in 510 asymptomatic males, aged 40 to 65, utilizing the bicycle ergometer, with maximal stress in 71% of the subjects. \"Ischemic changes\" occurred in 61 subjects, the frequency increasing from 4% at age 40 to 45, to 20% at age 50 to 55, to 37% at age 61 to 65. Subjects having an ischemic type ECG change on exercise had more frequent minor resting ECG changes, more resting hypertension, and a greater incidence of high cholesterol values than subjects with a normal ECG response to exercise, but there was no difference in the incidence of obesity, low fitness, or high systolic blood pressure after exercise. Current evidence suggests that asymptomatic male subjects with an abnormal exercise ECG develop clinical coronary heart disease from 2.5 to over 30 times more frequently than those with a normal exercise ECG."
