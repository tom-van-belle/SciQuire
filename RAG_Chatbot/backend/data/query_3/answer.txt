Based on the evidence retrieved, the most efficient way for men over 50 to stay fit is to combine regular brisk walking with progressive, moderate-to-vigorous aerobic exercise that ultimately achieves ≥ 5 METs (≈ 17 ml kg⁻¹ min⁻¹ VO₂) and to add strength training to preserve lean mass.

1. Brisk, habitual walking  
   In the prospective study “Habitual walking and its correlation to better physical function: implications for prevention of physical disability in older persons” (DOI: 10.1093/gerona/58.6.m555) every extra minute of self-reported daily walking raised VO₂max by 0.096 ml kg⁻¹ min⁻¹ and was associated with faster gait speed. Because walking is low-impact yet clearly linked to higher cardiorespiratory fitness and better physical function, it is an efficient starting point for men > 50.

2. Aerobic exercise that reaches ≥ 5 METs – and preferably 6–9 METs – is strongly protective.  
   The 20-year follow-up in “Exercise capacity and mortality in older men: a 20-year follow-up study” (DOI: 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.938852) showed that each 1-MET increment in peak exercise capacity lowered mortality risk by 12 %. Crossing the 5-MET threshold cut risk by 38 %, and reaching > 9 METs cut risk by 61 %. Even previously unfit men who improved to ≥ 5 METs lowered mortality by 35 % compared with those who stayed unfit.

3. Strength training to blunt the age-related loss of lean body mass.  
   The review “Rate and mechanism of maximal oxygen consumption decline with aging: implications for exercise training” (DOI: 10.2165/00007256-200333120-00002) notes that VO₂max falls ~10 % per decade, driven partly by loss of lean body mass. While maximal heart-rate decline is unavoidable, resistance exercise can preserve or rebuild muscle, indirectly supporting higher metabolic equivalents during aerobic work.

Putting it together, an efficient weekly programme for men > 50 is:  
- at least 150 min of brisk walking or equivalent moderate-intensity aerobic activity, progressing until an intensity that achieves ≥ 5 METs (e.g. walking uphill, cycling, rowing, jogging) can be sustained;  
- two non-consecutive sessions of whole-body resistance exercise (major muscle groups, 2–3 sets of 8–12 repetitions at moderate load) to maintain lean mass;  
- regular reassessment of exercise capacity (sub-maximal walk or treadmill test) to ensure the 5-MET threshold is at least maintained—or preferably advanced toward 6–9 METs—because survival benefit rises steeply above that level.
