None of the supplied abstracts describe any experiment in which CRISPR/Cas technology has already been used to treat, prevent, or reverse autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Consequently, at present there is no peer-reviewed evidence showing that CRISPR can “cure” autism.

The closest relevant datum is the observation that more than 80 % of grey-matter areas display altered fMRI activation in people with ASD (Examining the Dominant Presence of Brain Grey Matter in Autism During Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, doi:10.32598/bcn.2021.1774.3). These imaging differences are correlational, and no ASD-risk genes are validated to a level that would justify CRISPR editing. Until such genes are identified and their causal role is proven, CRISPR remains an experimental platform rather than an ASD therapeutic.
