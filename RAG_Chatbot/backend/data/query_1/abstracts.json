        "abstract_content": "T cell-mediated autoimmune type 1 diabetes (T1D) is under complex polygenic control in both humans and the NOD mouse model. However, in both species, particular major histocompatibility complex (MHC; designated HLA in humans) haplotypes provide the primary T1D risk factor. Both MHC/HLA class I and II variants interactively contribute to T1D by respectively driving autoreactive CD8 and CD4 T cell responses that cooperatively destroy insulin-producing pancreatic \u03b2 cells. While NOD mice have provided important insights to the pathogenic basis of T1D, the model has so far provided only a limited means to identify possible clinically translatable disease intervention approaches. This highlights a need to humanize NOD mice in ways that their pathogenic basis of T1D development becomes more similar to that characterizing the disease course in patients. In this review, we discuss the use of CRISPR/Cas9-generated murine-MHC-deficient NOD mice as a platform for introduction of patient-relevant HLA and T cell receptor molecules. These mice provide ever-improving models for development of clinically applicable interventions for T1D and other autoimmune diseases. \u00a9 2025 The Author(s) Current Protocols published by Wiley Periodicals LLC."

        "abstract_content": "This study investigates the effects and mechanism by which low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) regulates osteoporosis and hyperglycemia in mice with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). The mice were randomly divided into four groups: normal control (NC), T1DM mice (DM), T1DM mice treated with insulin (DM\u00a0+\u00a0INS), and T1DM mice treated with LIPUS (DM\u00a0+\u00a0LIPUS). The DM\u00a0+\u00a0INS group served as a positive control for the study. The DM\u00a0+\u00a0LIPUS group received LIPUS treatment (80\u00a0mW\u00a0cm-2, 20\u00a0min daily) on the quadriceps femoris for 6\u00a0weeks. The results show that LIPUS improves the mechanical properties, morphological characteristics, and bone microstructure and alleviate hyperglycemia in the T1DM mice. In addition, knockout of Piezo1 using CRISPR-Cas9 was performed in MC3T3-E1 cells (Piezo1-/-) to verify the role of LIPUS during treatment. The cell experiments showed that LIPUS improved proliferation, osteogenic differentiation capabilities, and cytoskeletal morphology, while significantly reducing the extracellular glucose level of MC3T3-E1 cells in a high glucose medium. All these results indicate that Piezo1-mediated mechanotransduction is closely related to the alleviation of osteoporosis and hyperglycemia in T1DM mice treated with LIPUS. LIPUS showed comparable efficacy to insulin in reducing the severity of osteoporosis and lowering hyperglycemia in T1DM mice. This therapy effectively alleviated symptoms (including osteoporosis and hyperglycemia) in T1DM mice without insulin injections. These findings suggest that LIPUS therapy could serve as an adjunct method to conventional diabetes treatment in T1DM."

Human pluripotent stem cell-derived \u03b2 cells (hPSC-\u03b2 cells) have emerged as a promising therapeutic alternative for restoring endogenous insulin production; however, limitations such as functional immaturity, immune rejection, and biosafety concerns such as tumorigenic risk continue to hinder clinical application. Recent advances in gene editing technologies, particularly clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9), offer precise tools to enhance or correct hPSC-\u03b2 cell performance by improving glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), reducing immune rejection, and reducing biosafety concerns. This review explores gene editing strategies developed to overcome the key barriers in hPSC-\u03b2 cell-based therapy for T1D. We highlight how genetic modifications enhance or correct \u03b2 cell function, promote immune evasion, and reduce biosafety concerns through precise and clinically relevant engineering.

Beta cell replacement therapies hold immense potential to restore natural insulin production, but they face significant hurdles such as immune rejection, limited donor availability, and long-term graft survival. In this review, we explore cutting-edge advances in genetic engineering, biomaterials, and machine learning approaches designed to overcome these barriers and enhance the clinical applicability of beta cell therapies. We highlight recent innovations in genetic editing techniques, particularly CRISPR/Cas9-based strategies, aimed at generating hypoimmune beta cells capable of evading immune detection. Additionally, we discuss novel biomaterial encapsulation systems, engineered at nano-, micro-, and macro-scales, which provide physical and biochemical protection, promote graft integration, and survival. We mention that recent advances in machine learning and computational modeling also play a crucial role in optimizing therapeutic outcomes, predicting clinical responses, and facilitating personalized treatment approaches. We also critically evaluate ongoing clinical trials, providing insights into the current translational landscape and highlighting both successes and remaining challenges. Finally, we propose future directions, emphasizing integrated approaches that combine genetic, biomaterial, and computational innovations to achieve durable, scalable, and immunologically tolerant beta cell replacement therapies for T1D."

        "year": 2025,
        "abstract_content": "It was previously reported that genetic ablation of the NF-\u03baB atypical inhibitor Bcl3 through congenic introduction of a 129P2-embryo derived knockout allele (Bcl3tm1Ver) accelerated autoimmune diabetes in the NOD mouse model. Conversely, we found that direct CRISPR-mediated ablation of this gene in the NOD/ShiLtDvs substrain completely inhibited diabetes development. Our CRISPR approach excised exons 3-7 within the NOD Bcl3 gene. These new NOD-Bcl3-/- mice had very low levels of insulitis, indicating protective mechanisms elicited early in the disease process. Dissimilar to reports of Bcl3 ablation in nonautoimmune C57BL/6-background mice, we found that splenic and lymph node B cells were not reduced. However, splenic T2 and MZ cells were increased with a disruption of B-cell follicle formation. Diabetes protection was associated with elevated splenic and lymph node regulatory T cells, and increases in CD4 effector and CD8 central memory T cells in pancreatic lymph nodes. Diabetes protection was overridden by anti-PD-1 administration. Previous studies suggested that Bcl3 may influence diabetes development downstream of Nfkbid, another atypical NF-\u03baB inhibitor. Indeed, co-introduction of this Bcl3 knockout allele also completely blocked diabetes in NOD-Nfkbid-/- mice normally characterized by accelerated disease. Collectively these findings support the possibility that prior findings may have been driven by congenic introduction of linked modifier genes from non-NOD background strains and initiate a critical reevaluation of the role of Bcl3 in type 1 diabetes pathogenesis."

        "abstract_content": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is widely recognized as a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by insufficient insulin production and persistent high blood sugar levels. Generally, the onset of T1D results from a complex network of factors that disrupt \u03b2-cell function. These contributing elements are broadly divided into intrinsic factors, such as genetic susceptibility, immune irregularities, and extrinsic triggers, including viral infections, drug toxicities, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and insufficient vitamin D levels. This article aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted mechanisms driving T1D, which often act directly or indirectly by influencing the immune system. This occurs due to a mix of genetic predispositions and immune system malfunctions. The article explores how genetic markers, including HLA-DR3/DR4, PTPN22, and TYK2 variants, influence and modulate immune tolerance. It also discusses emerging treatments, such as Teplizumab-mediated immune modulation, CRISPR-based gene editing, and stem cell-derived \u03b2-cell replacement, as well as their efficacy in preserving \u03b2-cell function to delay disease progression. By integrating recent therapeutic advancements with a deeper understanding of the molecular aspects of the disease, this article highlights next-generation treatments' potential to significantly improve the management of T1D. Future investigations should focus on precision medicine approaches to achieve greater success in long-term treatments."

In this study, we investigated the requirement for programmed death 1 (PD-1) expression by CD4+ T\u2009cells in the maintenance of self-tolerance via bystander suppression of autoreactive CD8+ T\u2009cells using nonobese diabetic mice. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to selectively knockout PD-1 in islet antigen-specific BDC2.5 CD4+ T\u2009cells and observed the impact on bystander tolerance of 8.3 CD8+ T\u2009cells, specific for a different islet antigen. Loss of PD-1 promoted the proliferation, Th1-like effector-memory phenotype, islet infiltration and expression of cytotoxic markers by BDC2.5 cells. PD-1-deficient BDC2.5 cells were impaired in their regulation of 8.3 cells, which proliferated more, developed an effector-memory phenotype and increased expression of effector molecules. While antigen-presenting cell maturation and migration into the pancreatic lymph node were not impacted by loss of PD-1 expression from BDC2.5 cells, migration of BDC2.5 cells out of the lymph node was required for enhanced activation of the CD8+ T\u2009cells. Together, these events led to accelerated diabetes progression, suggesting that PD-1 expression by CD4+ T\u2009cells promotes a tolerogenic microenvironment and restraining autoreactive CD8+ T\u2009cells."

In this review we explore the potential of stem-cell therapy as a transformative and curative approach for T1D, focusing on its promise in regenerating \u03b2-cells and addressing challenges specific to the pediatric population.\nDATA SOURCES: A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted to evaluate stem-cell types: embryonic, perinatal, adult, induced pluripotent and cancer stem cells, and their role in T1D treatment. Particular emphasis was placed on methods for \u03b2-cell differentiation, advancements in autologous and allogeneic stem-cell transplantation and emerging strategies to overcome safety, efficacy, and economic barriers. Challenges such as immune rejection, tumorigenicity, and cost-effectiveness were analyzed, alongside novel solutions like immune-shielding and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats\u00a0(CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated\u00a0protein-9 (Cas9) technology.\nRESULTS: Stem-cell therapy presents a promising avenue for curing T1D, offering potential for \u03b2-cell regeneration and reduced dependence on exogenous insulin.

Nevertheless, the mechanism underlying \u03b2-cell dysfunction in WFS2 remains elusive. Here we delineate the essential role of CISD2 in \u03b2-cells.\nMETHODS: We use \u03b2-cell specific Cisd2 knockout (Cisd2KO) mice, a CRISPR-mediated Cisd2KO MIN6 \u03b2-cell line and transcriptomic analysis.\nRESULTS: Four findings are pinpointed. Firstly, \u03b2-cell specific Cisd2KO in mice disrupts systemic glucose homeostasis via impairing \u03b2-granules synthesis and insulin secretion; hypertrophy of the \u03b2-islets and the presence of a loss of identity that affects certain \u03b2-cells. Secondly, Cisd2 deficiency leads to impairment of glucose-induced extracellular Ca2+ influx, which compromises Ca2+-mediated insulin secretory signaling, causing mitochondrial dysfunction and, thereby impairing insulin secretion in the MIN6-Cisd2KO \u03b2-cells. Thirdly, transcriptomic analysis of \u03b2-islets reveals that Cisd2 modulates proteostasis and ER stress, mitochondrial function, insulin secretion and vesicle transport. Finally, the activated state of two potential upstream regulators, Glis3 and Hnf1a, is significantly suppressed under Cisd2 deficiency; notably, their downstream target genes are deeply involved in \u03b2-cell function and identity.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings provide mechanistic insights and form a basis for developing therapeutics for the effective treatment of diabetes in WFS2 patients."

We explored the impact of both variants on \u03b2 cell function in vitro and assessed their relationship with C-peptide in people with T1DM and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).\nMETHODS: Using CRISPR/Cas9, the variants were introduced into a \u03b2 cell line (BRIN-BD11) and a T cell line (Jurkat cells) from which the conditioned media was applied to otherwise healthy \u03b2 cells to model the inflammatory environment associated with these variants.\nRESULTS: Both variants significantly reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduced expression of several \u03b2 cell markers and transcription factors (KCNJ11, KCNQ1, SCL2A2, GCK, NKX6.1, Pdx1 NGN3). However, HNF1A was significantly upregulated in the presence of both variants. We subsequently silenced HNF1A in variant expressing BRIN-BD11 cells using siRNA and found that gene expression profiles were normalised. Induction of each variant significantly increased expression of the lncRNAs they encode, which was normalised upon HNF1A silencing. Analysis of the DARE (Diabetes Alliance for Research in England) study revealed an association of rs10517086_A genotype with C-peptide in 153 individuals with T1DM, but not in 417 people with T2DM.\nCONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that rs1534422 and rs10517086 exert multiple insults on the \u03b2 cell through excessive upregulation of HNF1A and induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and highlight their utility as prognostic markers of \u03b2 cell function."

We previously discovered through CRISPR screening and validation experiments that Rnls inhibition prevents or delays T1D in multiple mouse models of diabetes in vivo, and protects pancreatic \u03b2 cells against autoimmune killing, ER and oxidative stress in vitro. The molecular biochemistry and functions of Rnls are largely uncharted. Here we studied the mechanisms of Rnls inhibition that underlie \u03b2 cell protection during diabetogenic stress.\nMETHODS: Akita mice were treated with oral Pargyline (PG) in vivo to bind and inhibit Rnls, and pancreas or islets were harvested for \u03b2 cell mass and \u03b2 cell function analyses. Genetic and pharmacological tools were used to inhibit Rnls in \u03b2 cell lines. RNA sequencing, metabolomics and metabolic function experiments were conducted in vitro in NIT-1 mouse \u03b2 cell lines and human stem cell-derived \u03b2 cells.\nRESULTS: In vivo, PG improved glycemia and mildly preserved \u03b2 cell mass and function in females. Genetic strategies to mutate (Rnlsmut) or knockout (Rnls KO) Rnls induced a robust metabolic shift towards glycolysis in both mouse and human \u03b2 cell lines, in vitro. Stress protection was abolished when glycolysis was blocked with 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG). Pharmacological Rnls inhibition with PG did not strongly mimic these newly identified metabolic mechanisms.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our work illustrates a role for Rnls in regulating cell metabolism. We show that inhibiting Rnls protects against chronic stress in vivo, and shields against acute stress in \u03b2 cell lines in vitro by rewiring cell metabolism towards glycolysis."

The REDLIP system is small enough to support packaging into adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), facilitating its therapeutic application. Demonstrating its capacity to treat metabolic diseases, we show that an AAV-delivered Fn-REDLIP system achieved optogenetic control of insulin expression to effectively lower blood glucose levels in type 1 diabetes model mice and control an anti-obesity therapeutic protein (thymic stromal lymphopoietin, TSLP) to reduce body weight in obesity model mice.

        "abstract_content": "AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Wolfram syndrome 1 (WS1) is an inherited condition mainly manifesting in childhood-onset diabetes mellitus and progressive optic nerve atrophy. The causative gene, WFS1, encodes wolframin, a master regulator of several cellular responses, and the gene's mutations associate with clinical variability. Indeed, nonsense/frameshift variants correlate with more severe symptoms than missense/in-frame variants. As achieving a genotype-phenotype correlation is crucial for dealing with disease outcome, works investigating the impact of transcriptional and translational landscapes stemming from such mutations are needed. Therefore, we sought to elucidate the molecular determinants behind the pathophysiological alterations in a WS1 patient carrying compound heterozygous mutations in WFS1: c.316-1G>A, affecting the acceptor splice site (ASS) upstream of exon 4; and c.757A>T, introducing a premature termination codon (PTC) in exon 7.\nMETHODS: Bioinformatic analysis was carried out to infer the alternative splicing events occurring after disruption of ASS, followed by RNA-seq and PCR to validate the transcriptional landscape. Patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were used as an in vitro model of WS1 and to investigate the WFS1 alternative splicing isoforms in pancreatic beta cells. CRISPR/Cas9 technology was employed to correct ASS mutation and generate a syngeneic control for the endoplasmic reticulum stress induction and immunotoxicity assays.\nRESULTS: We showed that patient-derived iPSCs retained the ability to differentiate into pancreatic beta cells. We demonstrated that the allele carrying the ASS mutation c.316-1G>A originates two PTC-containing alternative splicing transcripts (c.316del and c.316-460del), and two open reading frame-conserving mRNAs (c.271-513del and c.316-456del) leading to N-terminally truncated polypeptides. By retaining the C-terminal domain, these isoforms sustained the endoplasmic reticulum stress response in beta cells. Otherwise, PTC-carrying transcripts were regulated by the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) in basal conditions. Exposure to cell stress inducers and proinflammatory cytokines affected expression levels of the NMD-related gene SMG7 (>twofold decrease; p<0.001) without eliciting a robust unfolded protein response in WFS1 beta cells. This resulted in a dramatic accumulation of the PTC-containing isoforms c.316del (>100-fold increase over basal; p<0.001) and c.316-460del (>20-fold increase over basal; p<0.001), predisposing affected beta cells to undergo apoptosis. Cas9-mediated recovery of ASS retrieved the canonical transcriptional landscape, rescuing the normal phenotype in patient-derived beta cells.\nCONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This study represents a new model to study wolframin, highlighting how each single mutation of the WFS1 gene can determine dramatically different functional outcomes. Our data point to increased vulnerability of WFS1 beta cells to stress and inflammation and we postulate that this is triggered by escaping NMD and accumulation of mutated transcripts and truncated proteins. These findings pave the way for further studies on the molecular basis of genotype-phenotype relationship in WS1, to uncover the key determinants that might be targeted to ameliorate the clinical outcome of patients affected by this rare disease.\nDATA AVAILABILITY: The in silico predicted N-terminal domain structure file of WT wolframin was deposited in the ModelArchive, together with procedures, ramachandran plots, inter-residue distance deviation and IDDT scores, and Gromacs configuration files (doi/10.5452/ma-cg3qd). The deep-sequencing data as fastq files used to generate consensus sequences of AS isoforms of WFS1 are available in the SRA database (BioProject PRJNA1109747)."

        "abstract_content": "BACKGROUND: Endogenous insulin supplementation is essential for individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, current treatments, including pancreas transplantation, insulin injections, and oral medications, have significant limitations. The development of engineered cells that can secrete endogenous insulin offers a promising new therapeutic strategy for type 1 diabetes (T1D). This approach could potentially circumvent autoimmune responses associated with the transplantation of differentiated \u03b2-cells or systemic delivery of viral vectors.\nMETHODS: We utilized CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing coupled with homology-directed repair (HDR) to precisely integrate a promoter-free EMCVIRES-insulin cassette into the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the GAPDH gene in human HEK-293T cells. Subsequently quantified insulin expression levels in these engineered cells, the viability and functionality of the engineered cells when seeded on different cell vectors (GelMA and Cytopore I) were also assessed. Finally, we investigated the therapeutic potential of EMCVIRES-based insulin secretion circuits in reversing Hyperglycaemia in T1D mice.\nRESULT: Our results demonstrate that HDR-mediated gene editing successfully integrated the IRES-insulin loop into the genome of HEK-293T cells, a non-endocrine cell line, enabling the expression of human-derived insulin. Furthermore, Cytopore I microcarriers facilitated cell attachment and proliferation during in vitro culture and enhanced cell survival post-transplantation. Transplantation of these cell-laden microcarriers into mice led to the development of a stable, fat-encapsulated structure. This structure exhibited the expression of the platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule CD31, and no significant immune rejection was observed throughout the experiment. Diabetic mice that received the cell carriers reversed hyperglycemia, and blood glucose fluctuations under simulated feeding stimuli were very similar to those of healthy mice.\nCONCLUSION: In summary, our study demonstrates that Cytopore I microcarriers are biocompatible and promote long-term cell survival in vivo. The promoter-free EMCVIRES-insulin loop enables non-endocrine cells to secrete mature insulin, leading to a rapid reduction in glucose levels. We have presented a novel promoter-free genetic engineering strategy for insulin secretion and proposed an efficient cell transplantation method. Our findings suggest the potential to expand the range of cell sources available for the treatment of diabetes, offering new avenues for therapeutic interventions."

        "abstract_content": "A body develops an autoimmune illness when its immune system mistakenly targets healthy cells and organs. Eight million people are affected by more than 80 autoimmune diseases. The public's and individuals' well-being is put at risk. Type 1 diabetes, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosisare autoimmune diseases. Tissue injury, nociceptive responses, and persistent inflammation are the results of these stresses. Concerns about healthcare costs, health, and physical limitations contribute to these issues. Given their prevalence, it is crucial to enhance our knowledge, conduct thorough research, and provide all-encompassing support to women dealing with autoimmune diseases. This will lead to better public health and better patient outcomes. Most bacteria's immune systems employ CRISPR-Cas, a state-of-the-art technique for editing genes. For Cas to break DNA with pinpoint accuracy, a guide RNA employs a predetermined enzymatic pathway. Genetic modifications started. After it was developed, this method was subjected to much research on autoimmune diseases. By modifying immune pathways, CRISPR gene editing can alleviate symptoms, promote immune system tolerance, and decrease autoimmune reactivity. The autoimmune diseases that CRISPR-Cas9 targets now have no treatment or cure. Results from early clinical trials and preclinical studies of autoimmune medicines engineered using CRISPR showed promise. Modern treatments for rheumatoid arthritis,multiple sclerosis, and type 1 diabetes aim to alter specific genetic or immune mechanisms. Accurate CRISPR editing can fix autoimmune genetic disorders. Modifying effector cells with CRISPR can decrease autoimmune reactions. These cells include cytotoxic T and B lymphocytes. Because of improvements in delivery techniques and kits, CRISPR medications are now safer, more effective, and more accurately targeted. It all comes down to intricate immunological reactions and unexpected side consequences. Revolutionary cures for autoimmune problems and highly personalized medical therapies have been made possible by recent advancements in CRISPR."

        "abstract_content": "Despite the effectiveness of insulin injections in managing hyperglycemia in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), they fall short in addressing autoimmunity and regenerating damaged islets. This review aims to explore the potential and prospects of emerging treatment modalities for T1DM, including mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), MSC-derived exosomes, gene therapy, islet allotransplantation, pancreatic islet cell transplantation, and teplizumab. We review emerging treatment modalities for T1DM, highlighting several promising strategies with varied mechanisms and outcomes. Mesenchymal stem cells demonstrate potential in modulating the immune response and preserving or restoring beta-cell function, although variability in sources and administration routes necessitates further standardization. Similarly, MSC-derived exosomes show promise in promoting beta-cell regeneration and immune regulation, supported by early-stage studies showing improved glucose homeostasis in animal models, albeit with limited clinical data. Gene therapy, utilizing techniques like CRISPR-Cas9, offers targeted correction of genetic defects and immune modulation; however, challenges in precise delivery and ensuring long-term safety persist. Islet allotransplantation and pancreatic islet cell transplantation have achieved some success in restoring insulin independence, yet challenges such as donor scarcity and immunosuppression-related complications remain significant. Teplizumab, an anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody, has demonstrated potential in delaying T1DM onset by modulating immune responses and preserving beta-cell function, with clinical trials indicating prolonged insulin production capability. Despite significant progress, standardization, long-term efficacy, and safety continue to pose challenges across these modalities. Conclusion: While these therapies demonstrate significant potential, challenges persist. Future research should prioritize optimizing these treatments and validating them through extensive clinical trials to enhance T1DM management and improve patient outcomes."

Currently, there is no known cure, and treatment consists of daily insulin injections. Genome-wide association studies and twin studies have indicated a strong genetic heritability for type I diabetes and implicated several genes. As most strongly associated variants are noncoding, there is still a lack of identification of functional and, therefore, likely causal variants. Given that many of these genetic variants reside in enhancer elements, we have tested 121 CD4+ T-cell enhancer variants associated with T1D. We found four to be functional through massively parallel reporter assays. Three of the enhancer variants weaken activity, while the fourth strengthens activity. We link these to their cognate genes using 3D genome architecture or eQTL data and validate them using CRISPR editing. Validated target genes include CLEC16A and SOCS1. While these genes have been previously implicated in type 1 diabetes and other autoimmune diseases, we show that enhancers controlling their expression harbor functional variants. These variants, therefore, may act as causal type 1 diabetic variants."

However, diagnosis relies on measurement of vitamin B12 in the blood, which may not accurately reflect the concentration in the brain. Using programmable phage display, we identified an autoantibody targeting the transcobalamin receptor (CD320) in a patient with progressive tremor, ataxia, and scanning speech. Anti-CD320 impaired cellular uptake of cobalamin (B12) in vitro by depleting its target from the cell surface. Despite a normal serum concentration, B12 was nearly undetectable in her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Immunosuppressive treatment and high-dose systemic B12 supplementation were associated with increased B12 in the CSF and clinical improvement. Optofluidic screening enabled isolation of a patient-derived monoclonal antibody that impaired B12 transport across an in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Autoantibodies targeting the same epitope of CD320 were identified in seven other patients with neurologic deficits of unknown etiology, 6% of healthy controls, and 21.4% of a cohort of patients with neuropsychiatric lupus. In 132 paired serum and CSF samples, detection of anti-CD320 in the blood predicted B12 deficiency in the brain. However, these individuals did not display any hematologic signs of B12 deficiency despite systemic CD320 impairment. Using a genome-wide CRISPR screen, we found that the low-density lipoprotein receptor serves as an alternative B12 uptake pathway in hematopoietic cells. These findings dissect the tissue specificity of B12 transport and elucidate an autoimmune neurologic condition that may be amenable to immunomodulatory treatment and nutritional supplementation."

        "abstract_content": "AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Insulitis, a hallmark of inflammation preceding autoimmune type 1 diabetes, leads to the eventual loss of functional beta cells. However, functional beta cells can persist even in the face of continuous insulitis. Despite advances in immunosuppressive treatments, maintaining functional beta cells to prevent insulitis progression and hyperglycaemia remains a challenge. The cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1R), present in immune cells and beta cells, regulates inflammation and beta cell function. Here, we pioneer an ex vivo model mirroring human insulitis to investigate the role of CB1R in this process.\nMETHODS: CD4+ T lymphocytes were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from male and female individuals at the onset of type 1 diabetes and from non-diabetic individuals, RNA was extracted and mRNA expression was analysed by real-time PCR. Single beta cell expression from donors with type 1 diabetes was obtained from data mining. Patient-derived human islets from male and female cadaveric donors were 3D-cultured in solubilised extracellular matrix gel in co-culture with the same donor PBMCs, and incubated with cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3) for 24-48 h in the presence of vehicle or increasing concentrations of the CB1R blocker JD-5037. Expression of CNR1 (encoding for CB1R) was ablated using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Viability, intracellular stress and signalling were assayed by live-cell probing and real-time PCR. The islet function measured as glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was determined in a perifusion system. Infiltration of immune cells into the islets was monitored by microscopy. Non-obese diabetic mice aged 7 weeks were treated for 1 week with JD-5037, then euthanised. Profiling of immune cells infiltrated in the islets was performed by flow cytometry.\nRESULTS: CNR1 expression was upregulated in circulating CD4+ T cells from individuals at type 1 diabetes onset (6.9-fold higher vs healthy individuals) and in sorted islet beta cells from donors with type 1 diabetes (3.6-fold higher vs healthy counterparts). The peripherally restricted CB1R inverse agonist JD-5037 arrested the initiation of insulitis in humans and mice. Mechanistically, CB1R blockade prevented islet NO production and ameliorated the ATF6 arm of the unfolded protein response. Consequently, cyto/chemokine expression decreased in human islets, leading to sustained islet cell viability and function.\nCONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that CB1R could be an interesting target for type 1 diabetes while highlighting the regulatory mechanisms of insulitis. Moreover, these findings may apply to type 2 diabetes where islet inflammation is also a pathophysiological factor.\nDATA AVAILABILITY: Transcriptomic analysis of sorted human beta cells are from Gene Expression Omnibus database, accession no.

It has been shown that only a small number of stem cell-like \u03b2 cell-specific CD8+ T cells are needed to convert normal mice into T1D mice; thus, it is likely that T1D can be cured or significantly improved by modulating or altering self-reactive CD8+ T cells. However, stem cell-type, effector and exhausted CD8+ T cells play intricate and important roles in T1D.

Stem cell therapy is an effective treatment for diabetes and other pancreatic-related diseases, which can be achieved by inducing their differentiation into insulin-secreting cells. The liver is considered an ideal source of pancreatic cells due to its similar developmental origin and strong regenerative ability as the pancreas. This article reviews the traditional and emerging strategies using hepatocytes for pancreatic regenerative medicine and evaluates their advantages and challenges. Gene reprogramming and chemical reprogramming technologies are traditional strategies with potential to improve the efficiency and specificity of cell reprogramming and promote the transformation of hepatocytes into islet cells. At the same time, organoid technology, as an emerging strategy, has received extensive attention. Biomaterials provide a three-dimensional culture microenvironment for cells, which helps improve cell survival and differentiation efficiency. In addition, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 gene editing technology has brought new opportunities and challenges to the development of organoid technology."

        "abstract_content": "Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is a commonly occurring illness of autoimmune endocrine origin. It is usually present in the pediatric age group along with other well-known diseases, such as type 1 insulin-dependent diabetes. The defining feature of this disease is the immune-- mediated attack on the thyroid gland resulting in the destruction of thyroid tissues and cells. Given that HT frequently affects family members, it is well-recognized that individuals are genetically predisposed to this disease. Patients with HT also display a significantly increased risk for several different cancers, justifying the eminent need for the development of therapies for managing and treating HT. Gene editing has made several advancements in the field of molecular biology and has turned out to become a promising approach to correct several autoimmune diseases. Currently, CRISPR/Cas, a nuclease-based editing technique, is publicized as a promising tool for curing several genetic diseases and cancers. However, very limited research has been conducted as of now on autoimmune disease management and cure via CRISPR/Cas technique. This review provides an account of the potential candidate genes associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and only a few animal and human models have been generated via the CRISPR/Cas gene editing technique. Mouse models of autoimmune thyroiditis generated through the CRISPR/Cas gene editing technique by targeting the candidate genes will provide us with a deeper insight into the pathophysiology of HT and further pave the way for the immunomodulation of HT via gene editing."

Animal models play an important role in advancing mechanistic studies examining idiosyncratic drug reactions. However, to be useful, they must possess similarities to those seen clinically. Although mice currently represent the dominant mammalian genetic model, rats are advantageous in many areas of pharmacologic study where their physiology can be examined in greater detail and is more akin to that seen in humans. In the area of immunology, this includes autoimmune responses and susceptibility to diabetes, in which rats more accurately mimic disease states in humans compared with mice. For example, oral nevirapine treatment can induce an immune-mediated skin rash in humans and rats, but not in mice due to the absence of the sulfotransferase required to form reactive metabolites of nevirapine within the skin. Using CRISPR-mediated gene editing, we developed a modified line of transgenic rats in which a segment of IgG-like ectodomain containing the core PD-1 interaction motif containing the native ligand and therapeutic antibody domain in exon 2 was deleted. Removal of this region critical for mediating PD-1/PD-L1 interactions resulted in animals with an increased immune response resulting in liver injury when treated with amodiaquine."

Growing evidences have indicated the important role of type I interferon in the development of type 1 diabetes.\nMETHODS: Trex1-deficient rats were generated by using CRISPR-Cas9. The fasting blood glucose level of rat was measured by a Roche Accuchek blood glucose monitor. The levels of insulin, islet autoantibodies, and interferon-\u03b2 were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The inflammatory genes were detected by quantitative PCR and RNA-seq. Hematein-eosin staining was used to detect the pathological changes in pancreas, eye and kidney. The pathological features of kidney were also detected by Masson trichrome and periodic acid-Schiff staining. The distribution of islet cells, immune cells or ssDNA in pancreas was analyzed by immunofluorescent staining.\nRESULTS: In this study, we established a Trex1-deletion Sprague Dawley rat model, and unexpectedly, we found that the Trex1-/- rats spontaneously develop type 1 diabetes. Similar to human diabetes, the hyperglycemia in rats is accompanied by diabetic complications such as diabetic nephropathy and cataract. Mechanistical investigation revealed the accumulation of ssDNA and the excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines, including IFN-\u03b2, in Trex1 null pancreas. These are likely contributing to the inflammation in pancreas and eventually leading to the decline of pancreatic \u03b2 cells.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study links the DNA-induced chronic inflammation to the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes, and also provides an animal model for type 1 diabetes studies."

To date, there are no drugs that can prevent the development of T1D. Insulin replacement therapy is the standard care for patients with T1D. This treatment is life-saving, but is expensive, can lead to acute and long-term complications, and results in reduced overall life expectancy. This has stimulated the research and development of alternative treatments for T1D. In this review, we consider potential therapies for T1D using cellular regenerative medicine approaches with a focus on CRISPR/Cas-engineered cellular products. However, CRISPR/Cas as a genome editing tool has several drawbacks that should be considered for safe and efficient cell engineering. In addition, cellular engineering approaches themselves pose a hidden threat. The purpose of this review is to critically discuss novel strategies for the treatment of T1D using genome editing technology. A well-designed approach to \u03b2-cell derivation using CRISPR/Cas-based genome editing technology will significantly reduce the risk of incorrectly engineered cell products that could behave as a \"Trojan horse\"."

        "abstract_content": "In both humans and NOD mice, type 1 diabetes (T1D) develops from the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells by T cells. Interactions between both helper CD4+ and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells are essential for T1D development in NOD mice. Previous work has indicated that pathogenic T cells arise from deleterious interactions between relatively common genes which regulate aspects of T cell activation/effector function (Ctla4, Tnfrsf9, Il2/Il21), peptide presentation (H2-A\u2009g7, B2m), and T cell receptor (TCR) signaling (Ptpn22). Here, we used a combination of subcongenic mapping and a CRISPR/Cas9 screen to identify the NOD-encoded mammary tumor virus (Mtv)3 provirus as a genetic element affecting CD4+/CD8+ T cell interactions through an additional mechanism, altering the TCR repertoire. Mtv3 encodes a superantigen (SAg) that deletes the majority of V\u03b23+ thymocytes in NOD mice. Ablating Mtv3 and restoring V\u03b23+ T cells has no effect on spontaneous T1D development in NOD mice. However, transferring Mtv3 to C57BL/6 (B6) mice congenic for the NOD H2\u2009g7 MHC haplotype (B6.H2\u2009g7) completely blocks their normal susceptibility to T1D mediated by transferred CD8+ T cells transgenically expressing AI4 or NY8.3 TCRs. The entire genetic effect is manifested by V\u03b23+CD4+ T cells, which unless deleted by Mtv3, accumulate in insulitic lesions triggering in B6 background mice the pathogenic activation of diabetogenic CD8+ T cells. Our findings provide evidence that endogenous Mtv SAgs can influence autoimmune responses. Furthermore, since most common mouse strains have gaps in their TCR V\u03b2 repertoire due to Mtvs, it raises questions about the role of Mtvs in other mouse models designed to reflect human immune disorders."

These new models improved upon previously available platforms by retaining \u03b22-microglobulin functionality in FcRn and nonclassical MHC class I formation. As proof of concept, we generated H2-Db/H2-Kd double knockout NOD mice expressing human HLA-A*0201 or HLA-B*3906 class I variants that both supported autoreactive diabetogenic CD8+ T cell responses. In this follow-up work, we now describe the creation of 10 new NOD-based mouse models expressing various combinations of HLA genes with and without chimeric transgenic human TCRs reactive to proinsulin/insulin. The new TCR-transgenic models develop differing levels of insulitis mediated by HLA-DQ8-restricted insulin-reactive T cells. Additionally, these transgenic T cells can transfer insulitis to newly developed NSG mice lacking classical murine MHC molecules, but expressing HLA-DQ8. These new models can be used to test potential therapeutics for a possible capacity to reduce islet infiltration or change the phenotype of T cells expressing type 1 diabetes patient-derived \u03b2 cell autoantigen-specific TCRs."

Since describing these conditions, many PLCG2 variants of uncertain significance have been identified by clinical sequencing of patients with diverse features of ID.\nOBJECTIVE: We sought to functionally classify PLCG2 variants and explore known and novel genotype-function-phenotype relationships.\nMETHODS: Clinical data from patients with PLCG2 variants were obtained via standardized questionnaire. PLCG2 variants were generated by mutagenesis of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-PLCG2 plasmid, which was overexpressed in Plcg2-deficient DT-40 B cells. B-cell receptor-induced calcium flux and extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation were assayed by flow cytometry. In some cases, stimulation-induced calcium flux was also measured in primary patient cells.\nRESULTS: Three-fourths of PLCG2 variants produced functional alteration of B-cell activation, in\u00a0vitro. Thirteen variants led to gain of function (GOF); however, most functional variants defined a new class of PLCG2 mutation, monoallelic loss of function (LOF). Susceptibility to infection and autoinflammation were common with both GOF and LOF variants, whereas a new phenotypic cluster consisting of humoral immune deficiency, autoinflammation, susceptibility to herpesvirus infection, and natural killer cell dysfunction was observed in association with multiple heterozygous LOF variants detected in both familial and sporadic cases. In some cases, PLCG2 variants produced greater effects in natural killer cells than in B cells.\nCONCLUSIONS: This work expands the genotypic and phenotypic associations with functional variation in PLCG2, including a novel form of ID in carriers of heterozygous loss of PLCG2 function. It also demonstrates the need for more diverse assays for assessing the impact of PLCG2 variants on human disease."

However, the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on lupus nephritis (LN) and its underlying mechanisms remain unknown.\nMETHODS: We applied empagliflozin treatment to lupus-prone MRL/lpr mice to explore the renal protective potential of SGLT2 inhibitors. An SGLT2 knockout monoclonal podocyte cell line was generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system to examine the cellular and molecular mechanisms.\nRESULTS: In MRL/lpr mice treated with empagliflozin, the levels of mouse anti-dsDNA IgG-specific antibodies, serum creatinine and proteinuria were markedly decreased. For renal pathology assessment, both the glomerular and tubulointerstitial damages were lessened by administration of empagliflozin. The levels of SGLT2 expression were increased and colocalised with decreased synaptopodin in the renal biopsy samples from patients with LN and MRL/lpr mice with nephritis. The SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin could alleviated podocyte injury by attenuating inflammation and enhanced autophagy by reducing mTORC1 activity. Nine patients with LN treated with SGLT2 inhibitors with more than 2 months of follow-up showed that the use of SGLT2 inhibitors was associated with a significant decrease in proteinuria from 29.6% to 96.3%. Moreover, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was relatively stable during the treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors.\nCONCLUSION: This study confirmed the renoprotective effect of SGLT2 inhibitors in lupus mice, providing more evidence for non-immunosuppressive therapies to improve renal function in classic autoimmune kidney diseases such as LN."

However, the requirement for antigen (ag) specificity to optimally orchestrate tissue-specific, Treg cell-mediated tolerance limits effective clinical application. To address this challenge, we present a single-step, combinatorial gene editing strategy utilizing dual-locus, dual-homology-directed repair (HDR) to generate and specifically expand ag-specific engineered Treg (EngTreg) cells derived from donor CD4+ T\u00a0cells. Concurrent delivery of CRISPR nucleases and recombinant (r)AAV homology donor templates targeting FOXP3 and TRAC was used to achieve three parallel goals: enforced, stable expression of FOXP3; replacement of the endogenous T\u00a0cell receptor (TCR) with an islet-specific TCR; and selective enrichment of dual-edited cells. Each HDR donor template contained an alternative component of a heterodimeric chemically inducible signaling complex (CISC), designed to activate interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling in response to rapamycin, promoting expansion of only dual-edited EngTreg cells. Using this approach, we generated purified, islet-specific EngTreg cells that mediated robust direct and bystander suppression of effector T (Teff) cells recognizing the same or a different islet antigen peptide, respectively. This platform is broadly adaptable for use with alternative TCRs or other targeting moieties for application in tissue-specific autoimmune or inflammatory diseases."

        "abstract_content": "The autoimmune pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes (T1D) involves cellular infiltration from innate and adaptive immune subsets into the islets of Langerhans within the pancreas; however, the direct cytotoxic killing of insulin-producing \u03b2-cells is thought to be mediated primarily by antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. Despite this direct pathogenic role, key aspects of their receptor specificity and function remain uncharacterized, in part, due to their low precursor frequency in peripheral blood. The concept of engineering human T cell specificity, using T cell receptor (TCR) and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-based approaches, has been demonstrated to improve adoptive cell therapies for cancer, but has yet to be extensively employed for modeling and treating autoimmunity. To address this limitation, we sought to combine targeted genome editing of the endogenous TCR\u03b1 chain gene (TRAC) via CRISPR/Cas9 in combination with lentiviral vector (LV)-mediated TCR gene transfer into primary human CD8+ T cells. We observed that knockout (KO) of endogenous TRAC enhanced de novo TCR pairing, which permitted increased peptide:MHC-dextramer staining. Moreover, TRAC KO and TCR gene transfer increased markers of activation and effector function following activation, including granzyme B and interferon-\u03b3 production. Importantly, we observed increased cytotoxicity toward an HLA-A*0201+ human \u03b2-cell line by HLA-A*02:01 restricted CD8+ T cells engineered to recognize islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit (IGRP). These data support the notion of altering the specificity of primary human T cells for mechanistic analyses of autoreactive antigen-specific CD8+ T cells and are expected to facilitate downstream cellular therapeutics to achieve tolerance induction through the generation of antigen-specific regulatory T cells."

CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are both required to develop disease, but their relative roles in initiating disease are unclear. To test whether CD4+ T cell infiltration into islets requires damage to \u03b2 cells induced by autoreactive CD8+ T cells, we inactivated Wdfy4 in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice (NOD.Wdfy4-/--) using CRISPR/Cas9 targeting to eliminate cross-presentation by type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s). Similar to C57BL/6 Wdfy4-/- mice, cDC1 in NOD.Wdfy4-/- mice are unable to cross-present cell-associated antigens to prime CD8+ T cells, while cDC1 from heterozygous NOD.Wdfy4+/- mice cross-present normally. Further, NOD.Wdfy4-/- mice fail to develop diabetes while heterozygous NOD.Wdfy4+/- mice develop diabetes similarly to wild-type NOD mice. NOD.Wdfy4-/- mice remain capable of processing and presenting\u00a0major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II)-restricted autoantigens and can activate \u03b2 cell-specific CD4+ T cells in lymph nodes. However, disease in these mice does not progress beyond peri-islet inflammation. These results indicate that the priming of autoreactive CD8+ T cells in NOD mice requires cross-presentation by cDC1. Further, autoreactive CD8+ T cells appear to be required not only to develop diabetes, but to recruit autoreactive CD4+ T cells into islets of NOD mice, perhaps in response to progressive \u03b2 cell damage."

In this pursuit, islet allotransplantation under Edmonton's protocol emerged as a medical miracle to attain hypoglycemia-free insulin independence in T1D. Shortage of allo-islet donors and post-transplantation (post-tx) islet loss are still unmet hurdles for the widespread application of this therapeutic regimen. The long-term survival and effective insulin independence in preclinical studies have strongly suggested pig islets to cure overt hyperglycemia. Importantly, CRISPR-Cas9 technology is pursuing to develop \"humanized\" pig islets that could overcome the lifelong immunosuppression drug regimen. Lately, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived \u03b2 cell approaches are also gaining momentum and may hold promise to yield a significant supply of insulin-producing cells. Theoretically, personalized \u03b2 cells derived from a patient's iPSCs is one exciting approach, but \u03b2 cell-specific immunity in T1D recipients would still be a challenge. In this context, encapsulation studies on both pig islet as well as iPSC-\u03b2 cells were found promising and rendered long-term survival in mice. Oxygen tension and blood vessel growth within the capsules are a few of the hurdles that need to be addressed.

Limited work published to date focuses on stem cell-derived islets and work in a number of labs is ongoing. Rapid progress is occurring in the genome editing of human pluripotent stem cells and their progeny focused on evading destruction by the immune system in transplantation models, and while much research is still needed, there is no doubt the combined technologies of genome editing and stem cell therapy will profoundly impact transplantation medicine in the future."

        "abstract_content": "Type 1 diabetes is a polygenic disease that results in an autoimmune response directed against insulin-producing beta cells. PTPN2 is a known high-risk type 1 diabetes associated gene expressed in both immune- and pancreatic beta cells, but how genes affect the development of autoimmune diabetes is largely unknown. We employed CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate a functional knockout of PTPN2 in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) followed by differentiating stem-cell-derived beta-like cells (sBC) and detailed phenotypical analyses. The differentiation efficiency of PTPN2 knockout (PTPN2 KO) sBC is comparable to wild-type (WT) control sBC. Global transcriptomics and protein assays revealed the increased expression of HLA Class I molecules in PTPN2 KO sBC at a steady state and upon exposure to proinflammatory culture conditions, indicating a potential for the increased immune recognition of human beta cells upon differential PTPN2 expression. sBC co-culture with autoreactive preproinsulin-reactive T cell transductants confirmed increased immune stimulations by PTPN2 KO sBC compared to WT sBC. Taken together, our results suggest that the dysregulation of PTPN2 expression in human beta cell may prime autoimmune T cell reactivity and thereby contribute to the development of type 1 diabetes."

        "abstract_content": "The biggest drawback of a current diabetes therapy is the treatment of the consequences not the cause of the disease. Regardless of the diabetes type, preservation and recovery of functional pancreatic beta cells stands as the biggest challenge in the treatment of diabetes. Free radicals and oxidative stress are among the major mediators of autoimmune destruction of beta cells in type 1 diabetes (T1D) or beta cell malfunction and death provoked by glucotoxicity and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Additionally, oxidative stress reduces functionality of beta cells in T2D by stimulating their de-/trans-differentiation through the loss of transcription factors critical for beta cell development, maturity and regeneration. This review summarizes up to date clarified redox-related mechanisms involved in regulating beta cell identity and death, underlining similarities and differences between T1D and T2D. The protective effects of natural antioxidants on the oxidative stress-induced beta cell failure were also discussed. Considering that oxidative stress affects epigenetic regulatory mechanisms involved in the regulation of pancreatic beta cell survival and insulin secretion, this review highlighted huge potential of epigenetic therapy. Special attention was paid on application of the state-of-the-art CRISPR/Cas9 technology, based on targeted epigenome editing with the purpose of changing the differentiation state of different cell types, making them insulin-producing with ability to attenuate diabetes. Clarification of the above-mentioned mechanisms could provide better insight into diabetes etiology and pathogenesis, which would allow development of novel, potentially more efficient therapeutic strategies for the prevention or reversion of beta cell loss."

In insulin-secreting INS-1E cells, Nexmif expression increased strongly in response to oxidative stress. CRISPR Cas9-generated Nexmif knockout mice exhibited a reduced number of proliferating beta cells in pancreatic islets. RNA sequencing of pancreatic islets showed that the downregulated genes in Nexmif mutant islets are involved in stress response and the deposition of epigenetic marks. They include H3f3b, encoding histone H3.3, which is associated with the regulation of beta-cell proliferation and maintains genomic integrity by silencing transposable elements, particularly LINE1 elements. LINE1 activity has been associated with autism and neurodevelopmental disorders in which patients share characteristics with NEXMIF patients, and can cause genomic instability and genetic variation through retrotransposition. Nexmif knockout mice exhibited various other phenotypes. Mortality and phenotypic abnormalities increased in each generation in both Nexmif mutant and non-mutant littermates. In Nexmif mutant mice, LINE1 element expression was upregulated in the pancreas, brain, and testis, possibly inducing genomic instability in Nexmif mutant mice and causing phenotypic variability in their progeny."

        "abstract_content": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) remains a devastating disease that requires much effort to control. Life-long daily insulin injections or an insulin pump are required to avoid severe complications. With many factors contributing to disease onset, T1D is a complex disease to cure. In this review, the risk factors, pathophysiology and defect pathways are discussed. Results from (pre)clinical studies are highlighted that explore restoration of insulin production and reduction of autoimmunity. It has become clear that treatment responsiveness depends on certain pathophysiological or genetic characteristics that differ between patients. For instance, age at disease manifestation associated with efficacy of immune intervention therapies, such as depleting islet-specific effector T cells or memory B cells and increasing immune regulation. The new challenge is to determine in whom to apply which intervention strategy. Within patients with high rates of insulitis in early T1D onset, therapy depleting T cells or targeting B lymphocytes may have a benefit, whereas slow progressing T1D in adults may be better served with more sophisticated, precise and specific disease modifying therapies. Genetic barcoding and immune profiling may help determining from which new T1D endotypes patients suffer. Furthermore, progressed T1D needs replenishment of insulin production besides autoimmunity reversal, as too many beta cells are already lost or defect. Recurrent islet autoimmunity and allograft rejection or necrosis seem to be the most challenging obstacles. Since beta cells are highly immunogenic under stress, treatment might be more effective with stress reducing agents such as glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analogs. Moreover, genetic editing by CRISPR-Cas9 allows to create hypoimmunogenic beta cells with modified human leukocyte antigen (HLA) expression that secrete immune regulating molecules. Given the differences in T1D between patients, stratification of endotypes in clinical trials seems essential for precision medicines and clinical decision making."

        "abstract_content": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) in both humans and NOD mice is caused by T cell-mediated autoimmune destruction of pancreatic \u03b2 cells. Increased frequency or activity of autoreactive T cells and failures of regulatory T cells (Tregs) to control these pathogenic effectors have both been implicated in T1D etiology. Due to the expression of MHC class I molecules on \u03b2 cells, CD8 T cells represent the ultimate effector population mediating T1D. Developing autoreactive CD8 T cells normally undergo extensive thymic negative selection, but this process is impaired in NOD mice and also likely T1D patients. Previous studies identified an allelic variant of Nfkbid, a NF-\u03baB signal modulator, as a gene strongly contributing to defective thymic deletion of autoreactive CD8 T cells in NOD mice. These previous studies found ablation of Nfkbid in NOD mice using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats system resulted in greater thymic deletion of pathogenic CD8 AI4 and NY8.3 TCR transgenic T cells but an unexpected acceleration of T1D onset. This acceleration was associated with reductions in the frequency of peripheral Tregs. In this article, we report transgenic overexpression of Nfkbid in NOD mice also paradoxically results in enhanced thymic deletion of autoreactive CD8 AI4 T cells. However, transgenic elevation of Nfkbid expression also increased the frequency and functional capacity of peripheral Tregs, in part contributing to the induction of complete T1D resistance. Thus, future identification of a pharmaceutical means to enhance Nfkbid expression might ultimately provide an effective T1D intervention approach."

Based on the limitations of antioxidative and anti-inflammatory molecules in practical applications, targeting such interactions between harmful molecules and their cellular receptors/signaling with advances in gene engineering technology, such as CRISPR or TALEN, may prove to be a safe and effective alternative. In this review, we summarize the findings of recent studies focused on the deletion of scavenger receptors under oxidative stress as a development in the therapeutic approaches against the diseases linked to inflammation and the contribution of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), advanced lipid peroxidation products (ALEs), and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs)."

        "abstract_content": "Autoimmune diseases are disorders that destruct or disrupt the body's own tissues by its own immune system. Several studies have revealed that polymorphisms of multiple genes are involved in autoimmune diseases. Meanwhile, gene therapy has become a promising approach in autoimmune diseases, and clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats and CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) has become one of the most prominent methods. It has been shown that CRISPR-Cas9 can be applied to knock out proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) or block PCSK9, resulting in lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. In other studies, it can be used to treat rare diseases such as ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency and hereditary tyrosinemia. However, few studies on the treatment of autoimmune disease using CRISPR-Cas9 have been reported so far. In this review, we highlight the current and potential use of CRISPR-Cas9 in the management of autoimmune diseases. We summarize the potential target genes for immunomodulation using CRISPR-Cas9 in autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), multiple sclerosis (MS), type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), psoriasis, and type 1 coeliac disease. This article will give a new perspective on understanding the use of CRISPR-Cas9 in autoimmune diseases not only through animal models but also in human models. Emerging approaches to investigate the potential target genes for CRISPR-Cas9 treatment may be promising for the tailored immunomodulation of some autoimmune diseases in the near future."

We challenged human Tregs ex-vivo with pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 and observed greatly enhanced proliferation stimulated by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 (aCD3/28) beads or CD28 superagonist (CD28SA). The cytokine-exposed Tregs maintained high expression of FOXP3 and HELIOS, demethylated FOXP3 enhancer, and low IFN\u03b3, IL-4, and IL-17 secretion. Blocking TNF receptor using etanercept or deletion of TNF receptor 2 using CRISPR/Cas9 blunted Treg proliferation and attenuated FOXP3 and HELIOS expression. These results prompted us to consider using CD28SA together with IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 without aCD3/28 beads (beadless) as an alternative protocol for therapeutic Treg manufacturing. Metabolomics profiling revealed more active glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, increased energy production, and higher antioxidant potential during beadless Treg expansion. Finally, beadless expanded Tregs maintained suppressive functions in vitro and in vivo. These results demonstrate that human Tregs positively respond to proinflammatory cytokines with enhanced proliferation without compromising their lineage identity or function. This property can be harnessed for therapeutic Treg manufacturing."

        "abstract_content": "Signal regulatory protein SIRP\u03b3 (CD172G) is expressed on the surface of lymphocytes, where it acts by engaging its ligand, CD47. SIRPG, which encodes SIRP\u03b3, contains a nonsynonymous coding variant, rs6043409, which is significantly associated with risk for type 1 diabetes. SIRPG produces multiple transcript isoforms via alternative splicing, all encoding potentially functional proteins. We show that rs6043409 alters a predicted exonic splicing enhancer, resulting in significant shifts in the distribution of SIRPG transcript isoforms. All of these transcript isoforms produced protein upon transient expression in vitro. However, CRISPR/Cas9 targeting of one of the alternatively spliced exons in SIRPG eliminated all SIRP\u03b3 expression in Jurkat T cells. These targeted cells formed fewer cell-cell conjugates with each other than with wild-type Jurkat cells, expressed reduced levels of genes associated with CD47 signaling, and had significantly increased levels of cell-surface CD47. In primary CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, cell-surface SIRP\u03b3 levels in response to anti-CD3 stimulation varied quantitatively by rs6043409 genotype. Our results suggest that SIRPG is the most likely causative gene for type 1 diabetes risk in the 20p13 region and highlight the role of alternative splicing in lymphocytes in mediating the genetic risk for autoimmunity."

In humans, more than 60 loci carrying common variants that confer disease susceptibility have been identified by genome-wide association studies, with a low individual risk contribution for most variants excepting those of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region (40 to 50% of risk); hence the importance of missing heritability due in part to rare variants. Nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice recapitulate major features of the human disease including genetic aspects with a key role for the MHC haplotype and a series of Idd loci. Here we mapped in NOD mice rare variants arising from genetic drift and significantly impacting disease risk. To that aim we established by selective breeding two sublines of NOD mice from our inbred NOD/Nck colony exhibiting a significant difference in T1D incidence. Whole-genome sequencing of high (H)- and low (L)-incidence sublines (NOD/NckH and NOD/NckL) revealed a limited number of subline-specific variants. Treating age of diabetes onset as a quantitative trait in automated meiotic mapping (AMM), enhanced susceptibility in NOD/NckH mice was unambiguously attributed to a recessive missense mutation of Dusp10, which encodes a dual specificity phosphatase. The causative effect of the mutation was verified by targeting Dusp10 with CRISPR-Cas9 in NOD/NckL mice, a manipulation that significantly increased disease incidence. The Dusp10 mutation resulted in islet cell down-regulation of type I interferon signature genes, which may exert protective effects against autoimmune aggression. De novo mutations akin to rare human susceptibility variants can alter the T1D phenotype."

We have used induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural cells from individuals affected by WS in order to reveal their phenotypic and molecular correlates. We have observed that a subpopulation of Wolfram neurons displayed aberrant neurite outgrowth associated with altered expression of axon guidance genes. Selective inhibition of the ATF6\u03b1 arm of the unfolded protein response prevented the altered phenotype, although acute endoplasmic reticulum stress response-which is activated in late Wolfram degenerative processes-was not detected. Among the drugs currently tried in individuals with WS, valproic acid was the one that prevented the pathological phenotypes. These results suggest that early defects in axon guidance may contribute to the loss of neurons in individuals with WS."

Here, we describe an anti-HLA-A2 CAR (A2-CAR) generated by grafting the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of a human monoclonal anti-HLA-A2 antibody into the framework regions of the Herceptin 4D5 single-chain variable fragment and fusing it with a CD28-\u03b6 signaling domain. The CDR-grafted A2-CAR maintained the specificity of the original antibody. We then generated HLA-A2 mono-specific human CAR Tregs either by deleting the endogenous T-cell receptor (TCR) via CRISPR/Cas9 and introducing the A2-CAR using lentiviral transduction or by directly integrating the CAR construct into the TCR alpha constant locus using homology-directed repair. These A2-CAR+TCRdeficient human Tregs maintained both Treg phenotype and function in vitro. Moreover, they selectively accumulated in HLA-A2-expressing islets transplanted from either HLA-A2 transgenic mice or deceased human donors. A2-CAR+TCRdeficient Tregs did not impair the function of these HLA-A2+ islets, whereas similarly engineered A2-CAR+TCRdeficientCD4+ conventional T cells rejected the islets in less than 2 weeks. A2-CAR+TCRdeficient Tregs delayed graft-versus-host disease only in the presence of HLA-A2, expressed either by co-transferred peripheral blood mononuclear cells or by the recipient mice. Altogether, we demonstrate that genome-engineered mono-antigen-specific A2-CAR Tregs localize to HLA-A2-expressing grafts and exhibit antigen-dependent in vivo suppression, independent of TCR expression. These approaches may be applied towards developing precision Treg cell therapies for transplant tolerance."

When differentiated to the pancreatic lineage, his induced pluripotent stem cells stalled at the definitive endoderm (DE) stage. Metabolomics analysis of the cells revealed that this was associated with leucine hypersensitivity during transition from the DE to the pancreatic progenitor (PP) stage, and RNA sequencing showed that defects in leucine-sensitive mTOR pathways contribute to the differentiation deficiency. CRISPR/Cas9 manipulation of the PDX1 variant demonstrated that it is necessary and sufficient to confer leucine sensitivity and the differentiation block, likely due to disruption of binding of the transcriptional regulator NFY to the PDX1 5'-UTR, leading to decreased PDX1 expression at the early PP stage. Thus, the combination of an underlying defect in leucine catabolism characteristic of KPD with a functionally relevant heterozygous variant in a critical \u03b2-cell gene that confers increased leucine sensitivity and inhibits endocrine cell differentiation resulted in the phenotype of late-onset \u03b2-cell failure in this patient. We define the molecular pathogenesis of a diabetes syndrome and demonstrate the power of multiomics analysis of patient-specific stem cells for clinical discovery."

Often, intensive insulin therapy is insufficient, and patients require a pancreas or pancreatic islets transplant. However, both solutions are associated with many possible complications, including graft rejection. The best approach seems to be a donor-independent T1D treatment strategy based on human stem cells cultured in vitro and differentiated into insulin and glucagon-producing cells (\u03b2 and \u03b1 cells, respectively). Both types of cells can then be incorporated into the bio-ink used for 3D printing of the bionic pancreas, which can be transplanted into T1D patients to restore glucose homeostasis. The aim of this review is to summarize current knowledge about stem cells sources and their transformation into key pancreatic cells. Last, but not least, we comment on possible solutions of post-transplant immune response triggered stem cell-derived pancreatic cells and their potential control mechanisms."

Type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are the most common forms with both types having invariable genetic influence. It is accepted that a subset of all diabetes patients, generally estimated to account for 1-2% of all diabetic cases, is attributed to mutations in single genes. As only a subset of these genes has been identified and fully characterized, there is a dramatic need to understand the pathophysiological impact of genetic determinants on \u03b2-cell function and pancreatic development but also on cell replacement therapies. Pluripotent stem cells differentiated along the pancreatic lineage provide a valuable research platform to study such genes. This review summarizes current perspectives in applying this platform to study monogenic diabetes variants."

        "abstract_content": "AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Stimulator of IFN genes (STING) is a central hub for cytosolic nucleic acid sensing and its activation results in upregulation of type I IFN production in innate immune cells. A type I IFN gene signature seen before the onset of type 1 diabetes has been suggested as a driver of disease initiation both in humans and in the NOD mouse model. A possible source of type I IFN is through activation of the STING pathway. Recent studies suggest that STING also has antiproliferative and proapoptotic functions in T cells that are independent of IFN. To investigate whether STING is involved in autoimmune diabetes, we examined the impact of genetic deletion of STING in NOD mice.\nMETHODS: CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing was used to generate STING-deficient NOD mice. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to assess the level of type I IFN-regulated genes in islets from wild-type and STING-deficient NOD mice. The number of islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit-related protein (IGRP)<sub>206-214</sub>-specific CD8+ T cells was determined by magnetic bead-based MHC tetramer enrichment and flow cytometry. The incidence of spontaneous diabetes and diabetes after adoptive transfer of T cells was determined.\nRESULTS: STING deficiency partially attenuated the type I IFN gene signature in islets but did not suppress insulitis. STING-deficient NOD mice accumulated an increased number of IGRP<sub>206-214</sub>-specific CD8+ T cells (2878\u2009\u00b1\u2009642 cells in NOD.STING-/- mice and 728.8\u2009\u00b1\u2009196 cells in wild-type NOD mice) in peripheral lymphoid tissue, associated with a higher incidence of spontaneous diabetes (95.5% in NOD.STING-/- mice and 86.2% in wild-type NOD mice). Splenocytes from STING-deficient mice rapidly induced diabetes after adoptive transfer into irradiated NOD recipients (median survival 75\u00a0days for NOD recipients of NOD.STING-/- mouse splenocytes and 121\u00a0days for NOD recipients of NOD mouse splenocytes).\nCONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Data suggest that sensing of endogenous nucleic acids through the STING pathway may be partially responsible for the type I IFN gene signature but not autoimmunity in NOD mice. Our results show that the STING pathway may play an unexpected intrinsic role in suppressing the number of diabetogenic T cells."

SRSF6 down-regulation promotes \u03b2-cell demise through splicing dysregulation of central genes for \u03b2-cells function and survival, but how RNAs are targeted by SRSF6 remains poorly understood. Here, we define the SRSF6 binding landscape in the human pancreatic \u03b2-cell line EndoC-\u03b2H1 by integrating individual-nucleotide resolution UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) under basal conditions with RNA sequencing after SRSF6 knockdown. We detect thousands of SRSF6 bindings sites in coding sequences. Motif analyses suggest that SRSF6 specifically recognizes a purine-rich consensus motif consisting of GAA triplets and that the number of contiguous GAA triplets correlates with increasing binding site strength. The SRSF6 positioning determines the splicing fate. In line with its role in \u03b2-cell function, we identify SRSF6 binding sites on regulated exons in several diabetes susceptibility genes. In a proof-of-principle, the splicing of the susceptibility gene LMO7 is modulated by antisense oligonucleotides. Our present study unveils the splicing regulatory landscape of SRSF6 in immortalized human pancreatic \u03b2-cells."

Previously, we demonstrated CD4+ T cells from healthy donors and IPEX patients can be converted into functional Treg-like cells by lentiviral transfer of FOXP3 (CD4LVFOXP3). These CD4LVFOXP3 cells have potent regulatory function, suggesting their potential as an innovative therapeutic. Here, we present molecular and preclinical in vivo data supporting CD4LVFOXP3 cell clinical progression.\nMETHODS: The molecular characterisation of CD4LVFOXP3 cells included flow cytometry, qPCR, RNA-seq and TCR-seq. The in vivo suppressive function of CD4LVFOXP3 cells was assessed in xenograft-versus-host disease (xeno-GvHD) and FOXP3-deficient IPEX-like humanised mouse models. The safety of CD4LVFOXP3 cells was evaluated using peripheral blood (PB) humanised (hu)- mice testing their impact on immune response against pathogens, and immune surveillance against tumor antigens.\nRESULTS: We demonstrate that the conversion of CD4+ T cells to CD4LVFOXP3 cells leads to specific transcriptional changes as compared to CD4+ T-cell transduction in the absence of FOXP3, including upregulation of Treg-related genes. Furthermore, we observe specific preservation of a polyclonal TCR repertoire during in vitro cell production. Both allogeneic and autologous CD4LVFOXP3 cells protect from xeno-GvHD after two sequential infusions of effector T cells. CD4LVFOXP3 cells prevent hyper-proliferation of CD4+ memory T cells in the FOXP3-deficient IPEX-like hu-mice. CD4LVFOXP3 cells do not impede in vivo expansion of antigen-primed T cells or tumor clearance in the PB hu-mice.\nCONCLUSION: These data support the clinical readiness of CD4LVFOXP3 cells to treat IPEX syndrome and other immune-mediated diseases caused by insufficient or dysfunctional FOXP3+ Tregs."

However, developing nanomedicines that can cure autoimmune diseases without causing systemic immunosuppression is still quite challenging. Herein, we propose an all-in-one nanomedicine comprising an autoantigen peptide and CRISPR-Cas9 to restore specific immune tolerance by engineering dendritic cells (DCs) into a tolerogenic phenotype, which can expand autoantigen-specific regulatory T (Treg) cells. In brief, we utilized cationic lipid-assisted poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PEG-PLGA) nanoparticles to simultaneously encapsulate an autoimmune diabetes-relevant peptide (2.5mi), a CRISPR-Cas9 plasmid (pCas9), and three guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting costimulatory molecules (CD80, CD86, and CD40). We demonstrated that the all-in-one nanomedicine was able to effectively codeliver these components into DCs, followed by simultaneous disruption of the three costimulatory molecules and presentation of the 2.5mi peptide on the genome-edited DCs. The resulting tolerogenic DCs triggered the generation and expansion of autoantigen-specific Treg cells by presenting the 2.5mi peptide to CD4+ T cells in the absence of costimulatory signals. Using autoimmune type 1 diabetes (T1D) as a typical disease model, we demonstrated that our nanomedicine prevented autoimmunity to islet components and inhibited T1D development. Our all-in-one nanomedicine achieved codelivery of CRISPR-Cas9 and the peptide to DCs and could be easily applied to other autoimmune diseases by substitution of different autoantigen peptides."

RAGE expression was associated with an activated T cell phenotype, leading us to examine whether RAGE is involved in T cell signaling. In primary CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from patients with T1D or healthy control subjects, RAGE- cells showed reduced phosphorylation of Erk. To study T cell receptor signaling in RAGE+ or-T cells, we compared signaling in RAGE+/+ Jurkat cells, Jurkat cells with RAGE eliminated by CRISPR/Cas9, or silenced with siRNA. In RAGE KO Jurkat cells, there was reduced phosphorylation of Zap70, Erk and MEK, but not Lck or CD3\u03be. RAGE KO cells produced less IL-2 when activated with anti-CD3 +/- anti-CD28. Stimulation with PMA restored signaling and (with ionomycin) IL-2 production. Silencing RAGE with siRNA also decreased signaling. Our studies show that RAGE expression in human T cells is associated with an activated signaling cascade. These findings suggest a link between inflammatory products that are found in patients with diabetes, other autoimmune diseases, and inflammation that may enhance T cell reactivity."

Pluripotent stem cells can now be differentiated into beta cells, thus raising the prospect of a cell replacement therapy for T1D. However, autoimmunity would rapidly destroy newly transplanted beta cells. Using a genome-scale CRISPR screen in a mouse model for T1D, we show that deleting RNLS, a genome-wide association study candidate gene for T1D, made beta cells resistant to autoimmune killing. Structure-based modelling identified the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved drug pargyline as a potential RNLS inhibitor. Oral pargyline treatment protected transplanted beta cells in diabetic mice, thus leading to disease reversal. Furthermore, pargyline prevented or delayed diabetes onset in several mouse models for T1D. Our results identify RNLS as a modifier of beta cell vulnerability and as a potential therapeutic target to avert beta cell loss in T1D."

Treatments for the complications of LPI, including growth failure, renal disease, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, autoimmune disorders and osteoporosis, are limited. Given the early lethality of the only published global Slc7a7 knockout mouse model, a viable animal model to investigate global SLC7A7 deficiency is needed. Hence, we generated two mouse models with global Slc7a7 deficiency (Slc7a7em1Lbu/em1Lbu; Slc7a7Lbu/Lbu and Slc7a7em1(IMPC)Bay/em1(IMPC)Bay; Slc7a7Bay/Bay) using CRISPR/Cas9 technology by introducing a deletion of exons 3 and 4. Perinatal lethality was observed in Slc7a7Lbu/Lbu and Slc7a7Bay/Bay mice on the C57BL/6 and C57BL/6NJ inbred genetic backgrounds, respectively. We noted improved survival of Slc7a7Lbu/Lbu mice on the 129\u00a0Sv/Ev \u00d7 C57BL/6\u00a0F2 background, but postnatal growth failure occurred. Consistent with human LPI, these Slc7a7Lbu/Lbu mice exhibited reduced plasma and increased urinary concentrations of the cationic amino acids. Histopathological assessment revealed loss of brush border and lipid vacuolation in the renal cortex of Slc7a7Lbu/Lbu mice, which combined with aminoaciduria suggests proximal tubular dysfunction. Micro-computed tomography of L4 vertebrae and skeletal radiographs showed delayed skeletal development and suggested decreased mineralization in Slc7a7Lbu/Lbu mice, respectively. In addition to delayed skeletal development and delayed development in the kidneys, the lungs and liver were observed based on histopathological assessment. Overall, our Slc7a7Lbu/Lbu mouse model on the F2 mixed background recapitulates multiple human LPI phenotypes and may be useful for future studies of LPI pathology."

Conversely, T<sub>reg</sub> instability, characterized by loss of the master transcription factor Foxp3 and acquisition of proinflammatory properties2, can promote autoimmunity and/or facilitate more effective tumour immunity3,4. A comprehensive understanding of the pathways that regulate Foxp3 could lead to more effective T<sub>reg</sub> therapies for autoimmune disease and cancer. The availability of new functional genetic tools has enabled the possibility of systematic dissection of the gene regulatory programs that modulate Foxp3 expression. Here we developed a CRISPR-based pooled screening platform for phenotypes in primary mouse T<sub>reg</sub> cells and applied this technology to perform a targeted loss-of-function screen of around 500 nuclear factors to identify gene regulatory programs that promote or disrupt Foxp3 expression. We identified several modulators of Foxp3 expression, including ubiquitin-specific peptidase 22 (Usp22) and ring finger protein 20 (Rnf20). Usp22, a member of the deubiquitination module of the SAGA chromatin-modifying complex, was revealed to be a positive regulator that stabilized Foxp3 expression; whereas the screen suggested that Rnf20, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, can serve as a negative regulator of Foxp3. T<sub>reg</sub>-specific ablation of Usp22 in mice reduced Foxp3 protein levels and caused defects in their suppressive function that led to spontaneous autoimmunity but protected against tumour growth in multiple cancer models. Foxp3 destabilization in Usp22-deficient T<sub>reg</sub> cells could be rescued by ablation of Rnf20, revealing a reciprocal ubiquitin switch in T<sub>reg</sub> cells. These results reveal previously unknown modulators of Foxp3 and demonstrate a screening method that can be broadly applied to discover new targets for T<sub>reg</sub> immunotherapies for cancer and autoimmune disease."

We previously showed that CD137 expression in CD4 T cells inhibits T1D, but its expression in CD8 T cells promotes disease development by intrinsically enhancing the accumulation of \u03b2-cell-autoreactive CD8 T cells. CD137 is expressed on a subset of FOXP3+ regulatory CD4 T cells (Tregs), and CD137+ Tregs are the main source of soluble CD137. Soluble CD137 suppresses T cells in vitro by binding to the CD137 ligand (CD137L) upregulated on activated T cells. To further study how the opposing functions of CD137 are regulated, we successfully targeted Tnfsf9 (encoding CD137L) in NOD mice using the CRISPR/Cas9 system (designated NOD.Tnfsf9 -/-). Relative to wild-type NOD mice, T1D development in the NOD.Tnfsf9 -/- strain was significantly delayed, and mice developed less insulitis and had reduced frequencies of \u03b2-cell-autoreactive CD8 T cells. Bone marrow chimera experiments showed that CD137L-deficient hematopoietic cells were able to confer T1D resistance. Adoptive T cell transfer experiments showed that CD137L deficiency on myeloid APCs was associated with T1D suppression. Conversely, lack of CD137L on T cells enhanced their diabetogenic activity. Furthermore, neither CD137 nor CD137L was required for the development and homeostasis of FOXP3+ Tregs. However, CD137 was critical for the in vivo T1D-suppressive activity of FOXP3+ Tregs, suggesting that the interaction between CD137 and CD137L regulates their function. Collectively, our results provide new insights into the complex roles of CD137-CD137L interaction in T1D."

        "abstract_content": "Currently, type 1 diabetes requires lifelong insulin injection and careful blood glucose control to prevent secondary complications, but islet transplantation could make a type 1 diabetic patient insulin independent. On the other hand, islet transplantation needs human donors and donor shortage is the most serious issue. To alleviate the donor shortage, non-heart-beating and living donors were used; in addition, the efficacy of islet isolation and transplantation has been improved. However, the donor shortage issue will not be solved as long as human donors are the only source. To solve the donor shortage issue, islet xenotransplantation using porcine islets was initiated in 1994. Islet xenotransplantation has a potential to cure many type 1 diabetic patients, although there is the risk of developing serious or novel infection. Therefore, the World Health Organization has been interested in xenotransplantation, and the International Xenotransplantation Association (IXA) has published consensus statements to initiate xenogeneic islet transplantation. Clinical islet xenotransplantation was conducted under the official regulation, and safety and efficacy data have been accumulated. Currently an efficient method to overcome xenorejection is an important research target. In addition to traditional immunosuppressive drugs and immune isolation methods, the gene modification with CRISPR and blastocyst complementation have been investigated with promising outcomes. Once the xenorejection issue is overcome, islet xenotransplantation should become a curative treatment for type 1 diabetic patients."

Non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice spontaneously develop autoimmune diabetes akin to human type 1 diabetes. For this reason, the NOD mouse has been the preeminent murine model for human type 1 diabetes research for several decades. However, humanized mouse models are highly sought after because they offer both the experimental tractability of a mouse model and the clinical relevance of human-based research. Autoimmune T-cell responses against insulin, and its precursor proinsulin, play central roles in the autoimmune responses against pancreatic beta cells in both humans and NOD mice. As a first step towards developing a murine model of the human autoimmune response against pancreatic beta cells we set out to replace the murine insulin 1 gene (Ins1) with the human insulin gene (Ins) using CRISPR/Cas9. Here we describe a NOD mouse strain that expresses human insulin in place of murine insulin 1, referred to as HuPI. HuPI mice express human insulin, and C-peptide, in their serum and pancreata and have normal glucose tolerance. Compared with wild type NOD mice, the incidence of diabetes is much lower in HuPI mice. Only 15-20% of HuPI mice developed diabetes after 300 days, compared to more than 60% of unmodified NOD mice. Immune-cell infiltration into the pancreatic islets of HuPI mice was not detectable at 100 days but was clearly evident by 300 days. This work highlights the feasibility of using CRISPR/Cas9 to create mouse models of human diseases that express proteins pivotal to the human disease. Furthermore, it reveals that even subtle changes in proinsulin protect NOD mice from diabetes."

Here we report two improvements that increase the efficiency of CRISPR-Cas9-based genome editing in clinically relevant primary cell types. Truncated Cas9 target sequences (tCTSs) added at the ends of the homology-directed repair (HDR) template interact with Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) to shuttle the template to the nucleus, enhancing HDR efficiency approximately two- to fourfold. Furthermore, stabilizing Cas9 RNPs into nanoparticles with polyglutamic acid further improves editing efficiency by approximately twofold, reduces toxicity, and enables lyophilized storage without loss of activity. Combining the two improvements increases gene targeting efficiency even at reduced HDR template doses, yielding approximately two to six times as many viable edited cells across multiple genomic loci in diverse cell types, such as bulk (CD3+) T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, and primary and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived6 hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs)."

        "abstract_content": "Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are an immunosuppressive population that are identified based on the stable expression of the fate-determining transcription factor forkhead box P3 (Foxp3). Tregs can be divided into distinct subsets based on whether they developed in the thymus (tTregs) or in the periphery (pTregs). Whether there are unique functional roles that distinguish pTregs and tTregs remains largely unclear. To elucidate these functions, efforts have been made to specifically identify and modify individual Treg subsets. Deletion of the conserved non-coding sequence (CNS)1 in the Foxp3 locus leads to selective impairment of pTreg generation without disrupting tTreg generation in the C57BL/6J background. Using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology, we removed the Foxp3 CNS1 region in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model of spontaneous type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) to determine if pTregs contribute to autoimmune regulation. Deletion of CNS1 impaired in vitro induction of Foxp3 in na\u00efve NOD CD4+ T cells, but it did not alter Tregs in most lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues analyzed except for the large intestine lamina propria, where a small but significant decrease in ROR\u03b3t+ Tregs and corresponding increase in Helios+ Tregs was observed in NOD CNS1-/- mice. CNS1 deletion also did not alter the development of T1D or glucose tolerance despite increased pancreatic insulitis in pre-diabetic female NOD CNS1-/- mice. Furthermore, the proportions of autoreactive Tregs and conventional T cells (Tconvs) within pancreatic islets were unchanged. These results suggest that pTregs dependent on the Foxp3 CNS1 region are not the dominant regulatory population controlling T1D in the NOD mouse model."

Here we review CRISPR-based tools and discuss how they are being applied to decode the genetic circuits that control immune function in health and disease. Genetic variation in immune cells can affect autoimmune disease risk, infectious disease pathogenesis, and cancer immunotherapies.

Since these cells are responsible for insulin production, dysfunction or destruction of these cells necessitates blood glucose control through exogenous insulin shots. Curative treatment involves pancreas transplantation, but due to the incidence of transplant rejection and complications associated with immunosuppression, alternatives are being explored. Despite facing clinical challenges and issues with public perception, the field of regenerative stem cell therapy shows great promise for the treatment of diabetes. The idea of harnessing pluripotency to derive cells and tissues with characteristics of choice is astounding but feasible, and this review seeks to determine which method of stem cell derivation is preferable for diabetes treatment. In this report, we outline the methods for deriving human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and adult stem cells or progenitor cells to generate functional islet cells and related tissues. We discuss the specific uses and advantages of each method, and we comment on the ethics and public perceptions surrounding these methods and how they may affect the future of stem cell research. For the reasons outlined in this paper, we believe that non-embryonic stem cell lines, including iPSCs, somatic cell nuclear transfer lines, and adult tissue derived stem cells, offer the highest therapeutic potential for treating diabetes."

        "abstract_content": "The successful landmark discovery of mouse and human inducible pluripotential stem cells (iPSC's) by Takahashi and Yamanaka in 2006 and 2007 has triggered a revolution in the potential generation of self-compatible cells for regenerative medicine, and further opened up a new avenue for \"disease in dish\" drug screening of self-target cells (Neofytou et al. 2015). The introduction of four 'Yamanaka' transcription factors through viral or other transfection of mature cells can induce pluripotency and acquired plasticity. These factors include transduction with octamer-binding transcription factor-4 (Oct-4), nanog homeobox (Nanog), sex-determining region Y-box-2 (Sox-2) and MYC protooncogene (cMyc). Such cells become iPSC's (Takahashi and Yamanaka 2006). These reprogrammed cells exhibit increased telomerase activity and have a hypomethylated gene promotor region similar to embryonic stem cells (ESC's). These milestone discoveries have generated immense hope that diseases such as diabetes could be treated and effectively cured by transplantation of self-compatible, personalized autologous stem cell transplantation of \u03b2-cells that release physiological insulin under glycemic control (Maehr et al. 2009; Park et al. 2008) (Fig. 1). Diabetes is a profligate disease of disordered glucose metabolism resulting from an absolute or relative deficiency of insulin, the consequences of which lead to immense socio-economic societal burden. While there are many different types of diabetes, the two major types (type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are caused respectively by immune-mediated destruction (T1DM) or malfunctioning (T2DM) insulin-producing \u03b2-cells within the endocrine pancreas, the islets of Langerhans (Atkinson et al. 2011; Holman et al. 2015; You and Henneberg 2016). Almost 425\u00a0million people are affected by the global burden of diabetes, and this is predicted to increase by 48% (629\u00a0million) by 2045 (International Diabetes Federation Atlas 8th Ed 2018). Whole pancreas or islet cell transplantation offer an effective alternative to injected insulin, but both require lifelong potent immunosuppression to control both allo-and autoimmunity. Whole pancreas transplantation involves invasive complex surgery and is associated with greater morbidity and occasional mortality, while islet transplantation involves a minimally invasive intraportal hepatic infusion. Generally, whole pancreas transplantation provides greater metabolic reserve, but this may be matched by cumulative multiple islet infusions to achieve insulin independence. An additional challenge of islet transplantation is progressive loss of complete insulin independence over time, which may be multifactorial, the dominant factor however being ineffective control of autoimmunity. Both whole pancreas and islet transplantation are restricted to patients at risk of severe hypoglycemia that cannot be stabilized by alternate means, or in recipients that are already immunosuppressed in order to sustain a kidney or other solid organ transplant. The risks of chronic immunosuppression and the scarcity of human organ donors mean that both of these transplantation therapies cannot presently be extended to the broader diabetic population (Shapiro 2011; Shapiro et al. 2006). Recent progress in xenotransplantation of multiple knock-out 'humanized' pig islets could offer one potential solution, perhaps aided by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR associated-9 (CRISPR/Cas-9) gene editing approaches, but this remains to be proven in practice. Human stem cell derived new \u03b2-cell products could effectively address the global supply challenge for broad application across all forms of diabetes, but recurrent autoimmunity may still remain an insurmountable challenge. Considerable progress in the generation of human stem cell derived SC-\u03b2 cells from ESC, iPS and other adult cell sources such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) offer huge hope that a personalized, 'syngeneic' cell could be transplanted without risk of alloimmunity, thereby securing sufficient supply to meet future global demand (Cito et al. 2018)."

Differentiation of mutant cells resulted in insulin-negative endocrine stem cells expressing MAFA, NKX6.1, and chromogranin A. Correction of the mutation in stem cells and differentiation to pancreatic endocrine cells restored insulin production and insulin secretion to levels comparable to those of wild-type cells. Grafting of corrected cells into mice, followed by ablating mouse \u03b2 cells using streptozotocin, resulted in normal glucose homeostasis, including at night, and the stem cell-derived grafts adapted insulin secretion to metabolic changes. Our study provides proof of principle for the generation of genetically corrected cells autologous to a patient with non-autoimmune insulin-dependent diabetes. These cases should be readily amenable to autologous cell therapy."

Disease models with diverged genomes are necessary for understanding the genetic architecture of this complex disease. Non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice are highly polymorphic and widely used for studies of type 1 diabetes and autoimmunity. Understanding atherosclerosis development in the NOD strain is of particular interest as human atherosclerosis on the diabetic and autoimmune background has not been successfully modeled. In this study, we used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to genetically disrupt apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) expression on the pure NOD background, and compared phenotype between single-gene-deleted mice and double-knockout mutants with reference to ApoE-deficient C57BL/6 mice. We found that genetic ablation of Ldlr or Apoe in NOD mice was not sufficient to establish an atherosclerosis model, in contrast to ApoE-deficient C57BL/6 mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for over 12\u2005weeks. We further obtained NOD mice deficient in both LDLR and ApoE, and assessed the severity of atherosclerosis and immune response to hyperlipidemia in comparison to ApoE-deficient C57BL/6 mice. Strikingly, the double-knockout NOD mice treated with a HFD developed severe atherosclerosis with aorta narrowed by over 60% by plaques, accompanied by destruction of pancreatic islets and an inflammatory response to hyperlipidemia. Therefore, we succeeded in obtaining a genetic model with severe atherosclerosis on the NOD background, which is highly resistant to the disease. This model is useful for the study of atherosclerosis in the setting of autoimmunity."

Studies in NOD mice previously revealed that the common H2-Kd and/or H2-Db class I molecules expressed by this strain aberrantly lose the ability to mediate the thymic deletion of pathogenic CD8+ T cell responses through interactions with T1D susceptibility genes outside the MHC. A gene(s) mapping to proximal chromosome 7 was previously shown to be an important contributor to the failure of the common class I molecules expressed by NOD mice to mediate the normal thymic negative selection of diabetogenic CD8+ T cells. Using an inducible model of thymic negative selection and mRNA transcript analyses, we initially identified an elevated Nfkbid expression variant as a likely NOD-proximal chromosome 7 region gene contributing to impaired thymic deletion of diabetogenic CD8+ T cells. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genetic attenuation of Nfkbid expression in NOD mice resulted in improved negative selection of autoreactive diabetogenic AI4 and NY8.3 CD8+ T cells. These results indicated that allelic variants of Nfkbid contribute to the efficiency of intrathymic deletion of diabetogenic CD8+ T cells. However, although enhancing thymic deletion of pathogenic CD8+ T cells, ablating Nfkbid expression surprisingly accelerated T1D onset that was associated with numeric decreases in both regulatory T and B lymphocytes in NOD mice."

Here we developed a CRISPR-Cas9 genome-targeting system that does not require viral vectors, allowing rapid and efficient insertion of large DNA sequences (greater than one\u00a0kilobase) at specific sites in the genomes of primary human T cells, while preserving cell viability and function. This permits individual or multiplexed modification of endogenous genes. First, we applied this strategy to correct a pathogenic IL2RA mutation in cells from patients with monogenic autoimmune disease, and demonstrate improved signalling function. Second, we replaced the endogenous T cell receptor (TCR) locus with a new TCR that redirected T cells to a cancer antigen. The resulting TCR-engineered T cells specifically recognized tumour antigens and mounted productive anti-tumour cell responses in vitro and in vivo. Together, these studies provide preclinical evidence that non-viral genome targeting can enable rapid and flexible experimental manipulation and therapeutic engineering of primary human immune cells."

The focus is now turning toward the function of these association signals, determining the causal variant(s) among those in strong linkage disequilibrium, and identifying their underlying mechanisms, such as long-range gene regulation. Genome-editing techniques utilizing zinc-finger nucleases (ZFN), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and clustered regularly-interspaced short palindromic repeats with Cas9 nuclease (CRISPR-Cas9) are becoming the tools of choice to establish functionality for these variants, due to the ability to assess effects of single variants in vivo. This review will discuss examples of how these technologies have begun to aid functional analysis of GWAS loci for complex traits such as cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes, cancer, obesity, and autoimmune disease. We focus on analysis of variants occurring within noncoding genomic regions, as these comprise the majority of GWAS variants, providing the greatest challenges to determining functionality, and compare editing strategies that provide different levels of evidence for variant functionality. The review describes molecular insights into some of these potentially causal variants and how these may relate to the pathology of the trait and look toward future directions for these technologies in post-GWAS analysis, such as base-editing."

T1D susceptibility is restored to normally resistant NOD.\u03b22m-/- mice transgenically expressing human disease-associated HLA-A*02:01 or HLA-B*39:06 class I molecules in place of their murine counterparts. T1D is dependent on pathogenic CD8+ T-cell responses mediated by these human class I variants. NOD.\u03b22m-/--A2.1 mice were previously used to identify \u03b2-cell autoantigens presented by this human class I variant to pathogenic CD8+ T cells and for testing therapies to attenuate such effectors. However, NOD.\u03b22m-/- mice also lack nonclassical MHC I family members, including FcRn, required for antigen presentation, and maintenance of serum IgG and albumin, precluding therapies dependent on these molecules. Hence, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to directly ablate the NOD H2-Kd and H2-Db classical class I variants either individually or in tandem (cMHCI-/-). Ablation of the H2-Ag7 class II variant in the latter stock created NOD mice totally lacking in classical murine MHC expression (cMHCI/II-/-). NOD-cMHCI-/- mice retained nonclassical MHC I molecule expression and FcRn activity. Transgenic expression of HLA-A2 or -B39 restored pathogenic CD8+ T-cell development and T1D susceptibility to NOD-cMHCI-/- mice.

Here we show that a membrane-embedded human ZnT8 antigen triggered a vigorous immune response in ZnT8 knock-out mice. Approximately 50% of serum immunoreactivities toward ZnT8 were mapped to its transmembrane domain that is accessible to extracellular ZnT8 antibody (ZnT8A). ZnT8A binding was detected on live rat insulinoma INS-1E cells, and the binding specificity was validated by a CRISPR/Cas9 mediated ZnT8 knock-out. Applying established ZnT8A assays to purified serum antibodies from patients with type 1 diabetes, we detected human ZnT8A bound to live INS-1E cells, whereas a ZnT8 knock-out specifically reduced the surface binding. Our results demonstrate that ZnT8 is a cell surface self-antigen, raising the possibility of a direct involvement in antibody-mediated \u03b2-cell dysfunction and cytotoxicity."

        "abstract_content": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by the destruction of insulin-producing \u03b2-cells by immune cells in the pancreas. Pro-inflammatory including TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-1\u03b2 are released in the islet during the autoimmune assault and signal in \u03b2-cells through phosphorylation cascades, resulting in pro-apoptotic gene expression and eventually \u03b2-cell death. Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are a family of enzymes that regulate phosphorylative signalling and are associated with the development of T1D. Here, we observed expression of PTPN6 and PTPN1 in human islets and islets from non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. To clarify the role of these PTPs in \u03b2-cells/islets, we took advantage of CRISPR/Cas9 technology and pharmacological approaches to inactivate both proteins. We identify PTPN6 as a negative regulator of TNF-\u03b1-induced \u03b2-cell death, through JNK-dependent BCL-2 protein degradation. In contrast, PTPN1 acts as a positive regulator of IFN-\u03b3-induced STAT1-dependent gene expression, which enhanced autoimmune destruction of \u03b2-cells. Importantly, PTPN1 inactivation by pharmacological modulation protects \u03b2-cells and primary mouse islets from cytokine-mediated cell death. Thus, our data point to a non-redundant effect of PTP regulation of cytokine signalling in \u03b2-cells in autoimmune diabetes."

        "abstract_content": "B lymphocytes play a key role in type 1 diabetes (T1D) development by serving as a subset of APCs preferentially supporting the expansion of autoreactive pathogenic T cells. As a result of their pathogenic importance, B lymphocyte-targeted therapies have received considerable interest as potential T1D interventions. Unfortunately, the B lymphocyte-directed T1D interventions tested to date failed to halt \u03b2 cell demise. IgG autoantibodies marking humans at future risk for T1D indicate that B lymphocytes producing them have undergone the affinity-maturation processes of class switch recombination and, possibly, somatic hypermutation. This study found that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated ablation of the activation-induced cytidine deaminase gene required for class switch recombination/somatic hypermutation induction inhibits T1D development in the NOD mouse model. The activation-induced cytidine deaminase protein induces genome-wide DNA breaks that, if not repaired through RAD51-mediated homologous recombination, result in B lymphocyte death. Treatment with the RAD51 inhibitor 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2, 2'-disulfonic acid also strongly inhibited T1D development in NOD mice. The genetic and small molecule-targeting approaches expanded CD73+ B lymphocytes that exert regulatory activity suppressing diabetogenic T cell responses. Hence, an initial CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genetic modification approach has identified the AID/RAD51 axis as a target for a potentially clinically translatable pharmacological approach that can block T1D development by converting B lymphocytes to a disease-inhibitory CD73+ regulatory state."

        "abstract_content": "Due to their ease of isolation, differentiation capabilities, and immunomodulatory properties, the therapeutic potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has been assessed in numerous pre-clinical and clinical settings. Currently, whole pancreas or islet transplantation is the only cure for people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and, due to the autoimmune nature of the disease, MSCs have been utilised either natively or transdifferentiated into insulin-producing cells (IPCs) as an alternative treatment. However, the initial success in pre-clinical animal models has not translated into successful clinical outcomes. Thus, this review will summarise the current state of MSC-derived therapies for the treatment of T1D in both the pre-clinical and clinical setting, in particular their use as an immunomodulatory therapy and targets for the generation of IPCs via gene modification. In this review, we highlight the limitations of current clinical trials of MSCs for the treatment of T1D, and suggest the novel clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) gene-editing technology and improved clinical trial design as strategies to translate pre-clinical success to the clinical setting."

        "abstract_content": "The pathogenesis of human type 1 diabetes, characterized by immune-mediated damage of insulin-producing \u03b2-cells of pancreatic islets, may involve viral infection. Essential components of the innate immune antiviral response, including type I interferon (IFN) and IFN receptor-mediated signaling pathways, are candidates for determining susceptibility to human type 1 diabetes. Numerous aspects of human type 1 diabetes pathogenesis are recapitulated in the LEW.1WR1 rat model. Diabetes can be induced in LEW.1WR1 weanling rats challenged with virus or with the viral mimetic polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C). We hypothesized that disrupting the cognate type I IFN receptor (type I IFN \u03b1/\u03b2 receptor [IFNAR]) to interrupt IFN signaling would prevent or delay the development of virus-induced diabetes. We generated IFNAR1 subunit-deficient LEW.1WR1 rats using CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated protein 9) genome editing and confirmed functional disruption of the Ifnar1 gene. IFNAR1 deficiency significantly delayed the onset and frequency of diabetes and greatly reduced the intensity of insulitis after poly I:C treatment. The occurrence of Kilham rat virus-induced diabetes was also diminished in IFNAR1-deficient animals. These findings firmly establish that alterations in innate immunity influence the course of autoimmune diabetes and support the use of targeted strategies to limit or prevent the development of type 1 diabetes."

        "abstract_content": "In Australia, and internationally, the shortage of organ and tissue donors significantly limits the number of patients with critical organ or tissue failure who are able to receive a transplant each year. The rationale for xenotransplantation - the transplantation of living cells, tissues or organs from one species to another - is to meet this shortfall in human donor material. While early clinical trials showed promise, particularly in patients with type I diabetes whose insulin dependence could be temporarily reversed by the transplantation of porcine islet cells, these benefits have been balanced with scientific, clinical and ethical concerns revolving around the risks of immune rejection and the potential transmission of porcine endogenous retroviruses or other infectious agents from porcine grafts to human recipients. However, the advent of CRISPR/Cas9, a revolutionary gene editing technology, has reignited interest in the field with the possibility of genetically engineering porcine organs and tissues that are less immunogenic and have virtually no risk of transmission of porcine endogenous retroviruses. At the same time, CRISPR/Cas9 may also open up a myriad of possibilities for tissue engineering and stem cell research, which may complement xenotransplantation research by providing an additional source of donor cells, tissues and organs for transplantation into patients. The recent international symposium on gene editing, organised by the US National Academy of Sciences, highlights both the enormous therapeutic potential of CRISPR/Cas9 and the raft of ethical and regulatory challenges that may follow its utilisation in transplantation and in medicine more generally."

The NOD mouse is a spontaneous T1D model that shares with humans many genetic pathways contributing to T1D. We hypothesized that the introduction of the murine orthologous Ptpn22(R619W) mutation to the NOD genome would enhance the spontaneous development of T1D. We microinjected CRISPR-Cas9 and a homology-directed repair template into NOD single-cell zygotes to introduce the Ptpn22(R619W) mutation to its endogenous locus. The resulting Ptpn22(R619W) mice showed increased insulin autoantibodies and earlier onset and higher penetrance of T1D. This is the first report demonstrating enhanced T1D in a mouse modeling human PTPN22(R620W) and the utility of CRISPR-Cas9 for direct genetic alternation of NOD mice."

However, their availability is limited, and it is impossible to obtain them from patients with specific genotypes. Human pluripotent stem cells provide an alternative. Induced pluripotent stem cells can be generated from any individual's somatic cells and differentiated into pancreatic cells. Currently, this approach is limited by the immaturity of the islet-like cells derived from stem cells. However, this approach can already be used to model developmental defects, and the possibilities for studying insulin secretion are continuously improving. In addition, genome editing using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology provides powerful possibilities to study the impact of specific genotypes. The same technology can also be used for transcriptional regulation in order to improve the functional maturation of stem cell-derived islets. These tools are today becoming available for tomorrow's translational diabetes research."

        "abstract_content": "Genetic modification of the source pig offers the opportunity to improve the engraftment and survival of islet xenografts. The type of modification can be tailored to the transplant setting; for example, intraportal islet xenografts have been shown to benefit from the expression of anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory transgenes, whereas cytoprotective transgenes are probably more relevant for encapsulated islets. The rapid development of pig genetic engineering, particularly with the introduction of genome editing techniques such as CRISPR-Cas, has accelerated the generation of new pig lines with multiple modifications. With pre-clinical testing in progress, it is an opportune time to consider any implications of genetic modification for the conditions for undertaking clinical trials. Obviously, the stringent requirements to fulfill designated pathogen-free status that are applied to wild-type pigs will apply equally to genetically modified (GM) source pigs. In addition, it is important from a safety perspective that the genetic modifications are characterized at the molecular level (e.g., integration site, absence of off-target mutations), the phenotypic level (e.g., durability and stability of transgene expression), and the functional level (e.g., protection of islets in\u00a0vitro or in\u00a0vivo, absence of detrimental effects on insulin secretion). The assessment of clinical trial protocols using GM pig islets will need to be performed on a case-by-case basis, taking into account a range of factors including the particular genetic modification(s) and the site and method of delivery."

A previous, 2009, version of this consensus statement focused on strategies to prevent transmission of porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs). This version addresses potential transmission of all porcine microorganisms including monitoring of the recipient and provides suggested approaches to the monitoring and prevention of disease transmission. Prior analyses assumed that most microorganisms other than the endogenous retroviruses could be eliminated from donor animals under appropriate conditions which have been called \"designated pathogen-free\" (DPF) source animal production. PERVs integrated as proviruses in the genome of all pigs cannot be eliminated in that manner and represent a unique risk. Certain microorganisms are by nature difficult to eliminate even under DPF conditions; any such clinically relevant microorganisms should be included in pig screening programs. With the use of porcine islets in clinical trials, special consideration has to be given to the presence of microorganisms in the isolated islet tissue to be used and also to the potential use of encapsulation. It is proposed that microorganisms absent in the donor animals by sensitive microbiological examination do not need to be monitored in the transplant recipient; this will reduce costs and screening requirements. Valid detection assays for donor and manufacturing-derived microorganisms must be established. Special consideration is needed to preempt potential unknown pathogens which may pose a risk to the recipient. This statement summarizes the main achievements in the field since 2009 and focus on issues and solutions with microorganisms other than PERV."

Improved tools are needed to efficiently \"knock out\" genes and \"knock in\" targeted genome modifications to modulate T-cell function and correct disease-associated mutations. CRISPR/Cas9 technology is facilitating genome engineering in many cell types, but in human T cells its efficiency has been limited and it has not yet proven useful for targeted nucleotide replacements. Here we report efficient genome engineering in human CD4(+) T cells using Cas9:single-guide RNA ribonucleoproteins (Cas9 RNPs). Cas9 RNPs allowed ablation of CXCR4, a coreceptor for HIV entry. Cas9 RNP electroporation caused up to \u223c40% of cells to lose high-level cell-surface expression of CXCR4, and edited cells could be enriched by sorting based on low CXCR4 expression. Importantly, Cas9 RNPs paired with homology-directed repair template oligonucleotides generated a high frequency of targeted genome modifications in primary T cells. Targeted nucleotide replacement was achieved in CXCR4 and PD-1 (PDCD1), a regulator of T-cell exhaustion that is a validated target for tumor immunotherapy. Deep sequencing of a target site confirmed that Cas9 RNPs generated knock-in genome modifications with up to \u223c20% efficiency, which accounted for up to approximately one-third of total editing events. These results establish Cas9 RNP technology for diverse experimental and therapeutic genome engineering applications in primary human T cells."
