CRISPR technology is being explored as a precision tool to tackle the root immunological and cellular defects that drive autoimmune (type 1) diabetes.

1. Engineering immune tolerance  
   CRISPR-Cas systems can delete or re-write genes that tip the immune balance toward self-reactivity. By knocking-out pro-inflammatory master regulators or inserting tolerogenic factors, the edited cells re-programme the autoimmune response and blunt the destruction of β-cells (Current progress in CRISPR-Cas systems for autoimmune diseases, DOI: 10.1016/bs.pmbts.2024.07.011).

2. Reshaping the autoreactive T-cell repertoire  
   Targeted editing of T-cell genomes has already prevented diabetes onset in animal models. The approach removes or inactivates T-cell receptors that recognise β-cell antigens, thereby “reshaping” the repertoire away from autoimmunity (Applications of Genome-Editing Technologies for Type 1 Diabetes, DOI: 10.3390/ijms25010344).

3. Creating rejection-free, insulin-producing β-cell grafts  
   Donor islet cells can be CRISPR-edited to hide from the host immune system, eliminating the need for lifelong immunosuppression. In a recent first-in-human study, CRISPR-Cas12b plus lentiviral transduction produced allogeneic β cells that evaded immune recognition after fore-arm-muscle transplantation; the patient showed stable glucose-responsive C-peptide production without any immunosuppressive drugs (Survival of Transplanted Allogeneic Beta Cells with No Immunosuppression, DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2503822).

4. Correcting high-risk gene variants  
   CRISPR can correct susceptibility alleles such as HLA-DR3/DR4, PTPN22 and TYK2 in patient-specific stem cells, restoring immune tolerance and delaying or preventing disease progression (Shed light on molecular immunogenetic pathophysiology of type 1 diabetes to improve advanced treatment strategies, DOI: 10.1016/j.diabres.2025.112359).

Together, these CRISPR-based strategies move the field beyond symptom control toward durable, possibly curative, interventions for autoimmune diabetes.
